Thinking about [Spacefiller](https://spacefiller.space/fantasy-parameter-spaces/)'s work this morning. Specifically wondering how they're able to achieve such a feeling of solidity + presence for the plants. Part of it is the structure but I think a big part of it is the linework. There's no anti-aliasing and line's look like they're maybe four pixels wide (in visible world pixels, probably much higher in actual resolution).

I'm interested in creating digital spaces with a similar level of solidity. But I feel like introducing images often hurts the solidity - because the pixel pieces are too small to see. Obvious solution that I continue to experiment with is scale down the resolution and color of images, so that the pieces are more visible. That could hopefully make them feel more of a piece with a world like Spacefiller's. The dilemma is that often loses a lot of the semantic content (turns a face into a blob). This is part of why I'm interested in progressive pixelation that scales up or down in resolution depending on the content. Though my efforts there I think still lack the solid feel I'm after.
