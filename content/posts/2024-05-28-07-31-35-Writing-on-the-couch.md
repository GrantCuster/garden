# Writing on the couch

Trying to keep up the habit of quick writing in here. Now morning writing from the couch, the dog beside me, the baby exploring a cardboard box. A nice spring-like morning.

Did some organizing syncing the setups yesterday. Still liking the Ubuntu + Nix configuration. Getting better and faster about keeping it up to date across the laptop and the mini PC. The server's a bit behind.

For the glassese set-up I got audio and bluetooth working yesterday, so I think everything I wanted to do with that thing is proved out. I ordered a cross-body bag that I hope will fit everything well. Porch use has been good so far, interested in trying a commute with it. The battery pack has been working well, I'm surprised how much having an exact percent readout, rather than something like 4 lights, helps me feel secure about power draw.

I want to get clipboard history sorted today. Also want to make the nice gif recording set up with a notification in the top bar.
