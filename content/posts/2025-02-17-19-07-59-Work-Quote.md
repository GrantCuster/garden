# Work: Quote

![My new random quote page](https://grant-uploader.s3.amazonaws.com/2025-02-17-14-08-18-2000.jpg)

I built a [new little site](https://quote.grantcuster.com) to serve a random quote I've added to use as my new tab page. There's only like 9 quotes so far but hopefully I'll keep adding.

Along with the garden, this is another little app that runs on my server (digital ocean droplet) alongside it's admin app. Unlike the garden, this one even uses a database instead of flat files (for better or worse).
