Working on setting up a color scheme algorithm that gets me the 'most different' color each time I add a color. This is working for individual (hue, saturation, lightness) values within the ranges I set, but I guess because there is a periodicity to how I am setting each of those values it's not giving the results I hoped for. So I'm going to try and figure out a fix.
