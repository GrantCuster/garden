# Work: Bin wall

![Left wall I've my office, now filled with shoebox-sized bins.](https://grant-uploader.s3.amazonaws.com/2024-11-01-14-49-38-2000.jpg)

I've gone all in on clear shoebox + masking tape storage. Great for locating cords and small electronics so far. Still more to be figured out in terms of overall sorting (I'm hoping a natural cache will emerge?).
