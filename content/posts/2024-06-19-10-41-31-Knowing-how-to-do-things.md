# Knowing how to do things

Two comedy clips I think about surprising often. Tim Robinson on how not everyone knows everything:

Harris Wittels on not being impressed by juggling:

If you know how to do something it is because you learned how to do it. If you don't know how to do something it's because you haven't learned how to do it.

Kind of comforting.
