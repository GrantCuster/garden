Now writing this on the porch with the AR glasses. I think I finally got Network Manager set up so I feel more confident I can take these and connect to wifi outside of my own. Maybe I'll take them on their first train ride tomorrow.

I'm happy I've gotten as far as I did on this blog but I'm not quite sure how to use threads and untitled posts yet. Untitled posts feel weird even though part of the goal was to normalize that. Threads feel weird to, like it feels like I'm really declaring something important for it to be a thread. I want it to feel lightweight.
