# Writing on the porch

Hopefully the first of many posts written while sitting on the porch. This is the first one I've got set up with the AR glasses.

It was cool earlier when the light meant I could see more of the background, so it felt like a floating transparent screen. Now it's darker and the screen is less transparent.

I'll do a bigger post on the set up later, but I can list out briefly what I have going:

- Mele fanless mini PC
- Charging brick that outputs 45 watts
- Nreal AR Glasses
- Technikable keyboard
- Software running Sway and Neovim to write in

The battery / glasses / mini PC combo was recommended on Reddit and I'm happy it's all working together so well. The keyboard fits in well, though I still want to get mouse keys working. I'm excited for writing in this, should also be good for entertainment, even, I think, on the subway. I want to get or make a good cross-body bag to use with it.
