# Inspiration

Was somewhat randomly listening to this podcast about Zig: [Zig as a Multi-OS Build System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9nFvSpcCzo). And was struck by the description of Python's primary use to a lot of people being "bindings for interesting C libraries" (paraphrased). Which is actually a pretty good motivating statement for me to get better at setting up simple Python backends for some of my web experiments.
