A more literal simulation of what LIME does, as an experiment for the loading animation. Too confusing. The most literal would be to just perturb one item in a column at a time. But that seems like it would be a little slow and pedantic. I'm going to go back to color experiments, which are less literal but I think will have the right feeling.
