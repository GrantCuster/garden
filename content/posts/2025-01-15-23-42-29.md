I've been putting todo lists in project directories lately. I think it would be cool to have a system that searches up parent directories for todos.

So you could do something like a `todo` command and see todos for your current directory as well as a parent directory like `dev`. So a natural hierarchy.

I guess search / grep is probably also fast enough you could pretty easily search through child branches as well.
