# Magic terminal

It's holiday break and I'm doing some config stuff. I keep thinking about wanting to set my computer up as a "magic terminal". Where it boots into the command line - maybe into some combo of a tmux and neovim session, and everything is magical but through this sort of retro command line interface.

I feel like I'm making progress but also getting caught in the weeds...
