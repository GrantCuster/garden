I've got  proof-of-concept of workspaces in an infinite canvas working, but I'm hesitating a bit about building (again) out all the canvas/block niceties. Maybe just need to wait to be in the right mood for it. Today I did have an idea for a "workspaces as links" within a text document idea that I think I want to pursue in the meantime.
