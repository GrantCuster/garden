# It happened to me

I was writing a lot and then I decided I needed to redo the blog and then I thought I can't write more until I finish redoing the blog and so I wasn't writing.

So I pushed this version. It's more like Twitter, with individual entries and also the ability to thread. There are some unaswered questions (like pagination). I also can't decide if I should move all my feed posts in here. They might overwhelm the writing posts, but I think I'd like to figure out a way everything can live together.

I changed from bash scripts to typescript scripts, which has been helpful for organization. It's going well but I can also feel it in danger of sprawling out of what I can hold in my head -- and I feel like that is dangerous for solo projects, it's where it starts getting harder to jump back in and tinker. I should think about consolidating and carving up the pieces to make it easier to work on pieces at a time without feeling the stress that the whole thing might break.
