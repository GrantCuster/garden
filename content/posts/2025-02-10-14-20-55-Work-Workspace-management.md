# Work: Workspace management

![My new home screen config using Niri and Wabyar](https://grant-uploader.s3.amazonaws.com/2025-02-10-09-21-05-2000.jpg)

Trying out a new workspace technique. Home screen is a to do list, with the top unchecked item showing across workspaces in Waybar. Keyboard shortcut opens a new workspace with possibility to name. Toggle-able waybar sidebar shows all workspaces.

Early days but I'm enjoying it so far.
