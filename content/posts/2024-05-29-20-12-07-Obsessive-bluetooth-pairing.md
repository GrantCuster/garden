# Obsessive bluetooth pairing

I'm having trouble pairing my wireless keyboard with my mini PC. I keep trying new things and searching the proglem in different combos.

My current theory is maybe the bluetooth driver isn't up to date enough? But I think it actually may be.

The haunting thing is maybe it's just a bad state issue, and if I reset the right thing (firmware on the keyboard, bluetooth status on the keyboard) it will be all fixed up.

I should leave it. I have other things to do. It can sit. I can use the keyboard in wired mode with the mini PC and it works fine.

But every time I step away I think "well maybe..." and I have a strong urge to try something slightly different.

I think this general pattern has probably served me well in many computer and life things and badly in others. I'm going to do some chores now, but I also want to reflash the firmware.
