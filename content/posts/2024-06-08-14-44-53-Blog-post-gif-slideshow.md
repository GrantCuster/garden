# Blog post gif slideshow

Seeing the OG images I generate for this blog has me thinking. If you split a blog post by paragraphs and generated PNGs, and then you stitched those into a GIF with the frame time based on text length... that would maybe be a portable / embeddable blog post? Not good for accessibility and not to replace the post, but maybe an interesting derivative.
