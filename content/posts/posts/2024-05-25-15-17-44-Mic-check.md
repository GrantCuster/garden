# Mic check

Today I made this blog / garden. I want it to be a place where I can write quickly and with focus.

Right now it's a bunch of bash scripts that put together some templates. I wanted to know exactly what was going on so that I'll be able to modify it in the future. Though to be transparent the bash scripts were AI assisted. Still, I think I understand all the steps.

I want to keep things short.
