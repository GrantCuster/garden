# Is everything a prototype?

## Prototypes should look like prototypes

Prototypes shouldn't look too nice. They should look like a work-in-progress. They should [show their joints](/2024-05-31-07-16-31-Carving-at-the-joints/).

This keeps discussion at the right level of abstraction. You want to be talking about the capability, not the color scheme.

It also invites others to extend and modify the prototype in their mind. It encourages iteration.

## But then...

I believe in and make these arguments. But then as I make the case, I start to question, what work shouldn't have these qualities?

Shouldn't we always invite understanding and potential modification?

Should everything be a prototype? Is everything a prototype?

I think this connects to that Steve Jobs quote about the empowerment of understanding everything in the built world was designed by someone, and you can do it too.

Qualities that might be in conflict with prototypey-ness are durability and safety. Important things!

But I think a lot of objects aspire to a feeling of 'completeness' that is uneccesary.  They want to conceal evidence of their construction. I want to show it.
