# French cleat

I reorganized the garage space a bit and decided to finally try something I've watched many youtube videos on - a French cleat. In it's simplest form it's a board with one edge cut at a 45 degree angle. You can hang things on it with backers cut at the matching angle.

I love this kind of adjustability mostly because it cuts down on paralysis. I'm not sure how much I'll actually rearrange here (probably some) but the real advantage is I could make these tool holders without feeling like I'm 'locked in' to them or that I should deeply consider and optimize.

After getting these up and being impressed by the sturdiness I realized they were a good candidate for monitor mounting. The top I built for my desk is narrow, which saves on room space but was feeling a little cramped. I was losing several inches do to the mechanics of the arm mount I was using.

I swapped out the arm mount for a small cleat and I'm looking at it now. Our walls are weird because they're slats and plaster, I can never find the studs but I do always get to screw into the slats which feels solid (time will tell).

I liked the flow of figuring something out in the garage and then being able to apply it to the office.
