# Work: Basement project table

I feel like these quick builds are an exercise in building intuition about "how wood goes together". And then using it is building intuition about "what makes a table feel good to use", that then feeds into the next build.

## Process

Built out of 3/4" plywood and 2x6s (because I'm out of 2x4s). Nice to be at a stage where I can do this in a couple of hours. A bit wobbly either because of cuts or more likely the floor. But anchoring to the wall solved that. Left a reminder (mostly to myself) to keep it clear.
