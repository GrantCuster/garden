This pattern actually is pretty similar to the flow for Copilot-like autocomplete. But I'd be interested in taking it out of the editor and also making the encapsulation clearer.

I guess the risk is the usual spaghetti-hairball nodes-and-wires issues. I should develop some sort of plan for avoiding that.
