        <p>
          One of the best things I had going with my old linux set up was my gif
          recording workflow. I had a few helper scripts connected to dmenu (and
          then I think rofi and fzf), where I could record the screen and then
          convert into gif. It was still a bit janky. But it made it pretty
          quick to take work-in-progress clips and post to
          <a href="https://feed.grantcuster.com">my feed</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I tore down my set-up and rebuilt on Ubuntu server install and
          Nix home-manager I haven't had a good gif set up. Tonight I think I
          got it fixed up though I'm sure I will continue to tinker.

          Something I never had in the last one.

          I can't say I enjoy writing bash, but I'm starting to see more
          patterns, and have more of a base to reuse snippets from.
