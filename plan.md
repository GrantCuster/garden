Assets are a big issue -- cap at 15mb except in special cases?
make a static thumbnail for gifs, switch out for gif with intersection observer. or switch out for video?
should generating gif generate a video too? gifs are too usefully portable
but i could do something like mp4gif to indicate... if i have the videos on the site I could batch convert to gif automatically...

would mastodon and twitter post buttons be a big help?
could include text -- probably cannot include media?
maybe i can use script...

latest_tweet_text
latest_masto_text
use same truncation as the preview...
include link to post at end
should make a general neovim shortcut to open link in browser


Someday: pagination, incremental builds

Working: posts and threads
