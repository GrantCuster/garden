            I meant to write about this quote

            but got sidetracked:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              okay, to start, an analogy: long ago, a single person could build
              the best video game that existed. Adventure didn't require 200
              developers and 18 months to get out the door. as technology
              improved, so did expectations. Adventure was my goal. Today's
              kids' goal is fortnite. â€”<a

            The quote, and the thread it comes from, is about how complexity
            increases as a technology develops. It makes changing the system or
            proposing alternatives feel less approachable, because it's more
            difficult to hold the entire system in your head and think through
            how it could be modified.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's lots of echoes and analogs of that idea in my relationship
            to programming and tech. I was able to enter web development because
            it was relatively approachable at the time. I've been able to work
            at small start-ups because there's a similar dynamic at play in
            business, where a small entrant that is less conceptually confused
            can sometimes outmaneuver larger competitors. I wonder how much this
            approaches some sort of natural law and how much it's a result of
            the systems we've set up. Regardless, I'm glad it is the way it is,
            because I like working on small stuff I can hold conceptually in my
            head.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even though I believe that dynamic holds, I still get nervous about
            it in relation to my own work. I worry that I should have
            specialized more, become part of some larger project. I'd like to
            make things people engage with and I worry I won't get to the level
            of polish or features necessary with the small experiments I run. I
            worry that maybe there was a place for lower-level experiments
            earlier on but now web/software development has grown beyond it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I think about Minecraft (I also think about
            <a href="https://100r.co/site/home.html">100 Rabbits' work</a> which
            I should write about another time). The barriers for an indie game
            maker versus AAA game studios, in terms of the scope and polish they
            can afford, is much greater than web development, but indie studios
            have found a way (my impression from following game developers on
            Twitter is that it is a tough one). In Minecraft's case, it became
            one of the biggest games of all time, while deliberately avoiding
            competing on graphics.
          </p>

            Minecraft shows the possibilities of visible seams. Anything you see
            built in the world, you know it would be possible to construct
            yourself. Any grand construction you see online, you have some idea
            of how you could make it. I think a lot about the repetiveness of
            building a wall in Minecraft, which sort of cries out for some sort
            of scripting programming loop solution (can you automate building a
            wall with Redstone, maybe?). There's something pure about the
            mundane repetetiveness of it, though, it seems to bring it closer to
            DIY building in the real world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Minecraft puts you in a world with a simple and universal mental
            model of how things are constructed (though crafting is a less
            elemental secondary system). I want to do something like that, but
            with software, and rather than keeping you in this constructed
            world, I want that software to open out, so you can bring in outside
            things and create things that can go outside. And maybe, also, the
            mental model I introduce in the software opens out into more general
            programming, and gives you a foundational mental model to build on.
