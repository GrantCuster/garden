                  First ambient TV prototype is put together. Laptop strapped to
                  a monitor with a macropad control. One button for random
                  shuffle. Currently featuring Terry B bike riding, Primitive
                  Technology and Rambalac. More iterations to come.

              Finished listening to the Diamond Age. Pretty fun! The primer was
              maybe a little different than what I expected from hearing it
              referenced. But man I will always love an experience that secretly
              teaches you how to run it yourself. Need to read the Andy
              Matuschak essay now.

              A lot of us are trying to figure out how to use LLMs as a creative
              tool. There's a set of projects related to creative coding that
              I've been thinking about lately and want to round up.

                  This pattern actually is pretty similar to the flow for
                  Copilot-like autocomplete. But I'd be interested in taking it
                  out of the editor and also making the encapsulation clearer.

                  I guess the risk is the usual spaghetti-hairball

                  avoiding that.

              It varies a lot day-to-day but I think it's safe to say I'm mildly
              stressed about the overall impact of AI. I've worked with machine
              learning for a long time now -- falling into with Fast Forward
              Labs ten years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              At their best, I think current developments encourage me to think
              about what I want -- out of work, out of computers. There's parts
              of some of my past work where I think the idea was part of what
              made it interesting to others, but also a big part was that I put
              in more work (as the Penn and Teller quote goes) than a reasonable
              person was willing too. The need to put in work in that specific
              way seems to be going away (the code could be generated instead).
            </p>
            <p>
              There's still places to put in the work:
              <a
                href="https://garden.grantcuster.com/2024-05-31-07-16-31-Carving-at-the-joints/"
                >carving the joints</a
              >
              is partly me trying to work that out. In figuring out how to put
              systems together, and the experience of that past work will aid in
              that... but it does feel like it will be different.

              A bit of a dip in my new writing habit, mostly because my parents
              were in town for the weekend. Also maybe have some sort of
              lingering illness. Hoping it's just a temporary blip. I'm still
              enjoying the idea of this blog.

              Been trying to take some stock of where my work and projects are
              at. The pace of AI experimentation feels a bit exhausting, and a
              lot of it feels like hype. At the same time there do appear to be
              some movements towards steerability, to interaction at a more
              feature-based and interpretable level that are interesting to me.
              I'm still looking to carve at the joints and put the right pieces
              together in the right order to make something that feels
              empowering and extended, rather than a replacement. But it varies
              day-to-day how achievable and likely I think that is.

                  mini PC in the cross-body bag. Trying to get more of a feel

                  finally got Network Manager set up so I feel more confident I
                  can take these and connect to wifi outside of my own. Maybe

                  I'm happy I've gotten as far as I did on this blog but I'm not
                  quite sure how to use threads and untitled posts yet. Untitled
                  posts feel weird even though part of the goal was to normalize
                  that. Threads feel weird to, like it feels like I'm really
                  declaring something important for it to be a thread. I want it
                  to feel lightweight.

                  It would be cool to make using the garden a fullscreen

              I was writing a lot and then I decided I needed to redo the blog
              and then I thought I can't write more until I finish redoing the
              blog and so I wasn't writing.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I pushed this version. It's more like Twitter, with individual
              entries and also the ability to thread. There are some unaswered
              questions (like pagination). I also can't decide if I should move
              all my feed posts in here. They might overwhelm the writing posts,
              but I think I'd like to figure out a way everything can live
              together.

                  Through work, I've been playing with the Gemini model's
                  ability to return bounding boxes for an image. I think I want
                  to try and use it to make some sort of image (sketch or photo)
                  to website generator. Maybe leaning into skeuommorphism of
                  like a photo of a physical desktop that contains all the links
                  to my projects as items on the desk.

              Seeing the OG images I generate for this blog has me thinking. If
              you split a blog post by paragraphs and generated PNGs, and then
              you stitched those into a GIF with the frame time based on text
              length... that would maybe be a portable / embeddable blog post?
              Not good for accessibility and not to replace the post, but maybe
              an interesting derivative.

              This site is a bash build script that concats HTML together. I
              also put together a little start script using fzf that has some
              common task options new_post / build / commit. I really like the
              feel of the starting bash script - it makes it feel like writing
              in this blog is its own little dedicated computer program.

              Thinking about things that make you see the world around you
              differently: ARGs, birding, mushroom hunting, simulating physical

              and they mentioned "secrets in plain sight" in the game and
              compared it to ARGs, where your street becomes something
              new/different to you because there is a geocache (or pokemon
              station there).

              What if I made a blog like this blog but also more like Twitter.
              Where I could make little posts, or I could also reply to old
              posts, bumping that 'thread' of posts to the top. But (like
              Twitter) it would show the update, with an indication and ability
              to click through to see the full thread.
            </p>
            <p>
              That seems kind of cool? Like it'd be good for long-running
              thoughts I keep returning to and also for WIP posts...

              I would say this garden has been a relative success in terms of
              helping me write more. I kind of want to combine it with my feed,
              and maybe my homepage?
            </p>
            <p>
              Feed would be the thing to do first I think. It's interesting
              trying to categorize the differences between posts. Garden is more
              writing based. Feed is structured around an image. Feed was
              designed to make sure I wasn't blocked trying to think of a title,
              that I could do more work-in-progress stuff. Maybe that's
              different now that garden is here.

              One of the best things I had going with my old linux set up was my
              gif recording workflow. I had a few helper scripts connected to
              dmenu (and then I think rofi and fzf), where I could record the
              screen and then convert into gif. It was still a bit janky. But it
              made it pretty quick to take work-in-progress clips and post to

              Since I tore down my set-up and rebuilt on Ubuntu server install
              and Nix home-manager I haven't had a good gif set up. Tonight I
              think I got it fixed up though I'm sure I will continue to tinker.

              I'm not sure if it was from reflashing the keyboard firmware or

              Obsessive bluetooth pairing

            <p>
              I'm having trouble pairing my wireless keyboard with my mini PC. I
              keep trying new things and searching the proglem in different
              combos.
            </p>
            <p>
              My current theory is maybe the bluetooth driver isn't up to date
              enough? But I think it actually may be.

              Trying to keep up the habit of quick writing in here. Now morning
              writing from the couch, the dog beside me, the baby exploring a
              cardboard box. A nice spring-like morning.

              Did some organizing syncing the setups yesterday. Still liking the
              Ubuntu + Nix configuration. Getting better and faster about
              keeping it up to date across the laptop and the mini PC. The
              server's a bit behind.

              Hopefully the first of many posts written while sitting on the
              porch. This is the first one I've got set up with the AR glasses.

              It was cool earlier when the light meant I could see more of the
              background, so it felt like a floating transparent screen. Now
              it's darker and the screen is less transparent.

              This blog!: I want to get preview images working. I'm trying to
              generate them using cairo, so I can do it as part of the build
              script. I would say I've proven out the basic concept, now need to
              decide on some text positioning and hook it all together for the
              first run.
            </p>

              Mini PC: I'm working on getting a mini PC set up with the my
              current go-to Ubuntu server + Nix home-manager config. Eventually
              I want to try and make it a wearable deck to go with my AR
              glasses. Will write about that more later.

              I want to make sure I can write from anywhere, including my work
              mac, which I'm writing on now. I had to update bash on the mac (I
              did it using Nix home manager). Otherwise things seem to be
              working well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Edit: also had to replace a <code>grep P</code> with a
              <code>sed</code>.

              Today I made this blog / garden. I want it to be a place where I
              can write quickly and with focus.

            <p>
              Right now it's a bunch of bash scripts that put together some
              templates. I wanted to know exactly what was going on so that I'll
              be able to modify it in the future. Though to be transparent the
              bash scripts were AI assisted. Still, I think I understand all the
              steps.
