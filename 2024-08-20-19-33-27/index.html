            Finally wearing my AR glasses combo out on the commute. Made some
            decent progress trying to paginate this blog today. Pushed the scale
            up to 2x which is helping. Also think I've got a good base system
            set up (refined from reinstalling across a bunch of computers of all
            the time) and that's helping.
