            I want to think more about some connected ideas. Silicon Jungle's
            prototypes where he is exploring breaking ideas into cards, I think
            called lenses, that can then be further explored.
          </p>
          <p>Linus Lee's talk about using LLMs as a microscope for thoughts.</p>
          <p>
            Some work experiments where we've been using LLMs to break scenes
            down into parts, then applying a transformation to one of those
            parts.
          </p>
          <p>I'm writing this on the train so references are from memory</p>
          <p>
            I really liked Silicon Jungle breaking it down into cards, it felt
            like a useful metaphor. Especially I thought of deck-building. There
            I'm still influenced by a short obsession with Marvel Snap. I like
            that, like building a good game deck, you want both supporter ideas
            and big powerful ideas. I think maybe pushing the metaphor further
            and giving cards values and play cost wouldn't be very useful -
            maybe some loose categorization to help with how to fit them
            together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also connects to having a "bag of tricks". There was a Ben Pierrat
            project that made use of that idea - something with "fake" in it?
          </p>
          <p>
            And then there's the Feynman idea I always return to, of having ten
            favorite problems and every time you learn a new thing you see if
            they are a good fit for any of your problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            A hard part of this is what abstraction level to break things into.
            I'm not sure the card thing solvjes that exactly, but it makes it
            easier to accept. We're used to cards of various value (does value
            map to abstraction).
          </p>
          <p>
            I still want to do an abstraction focused prototype - maybe using
            trees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cards also have the connection to Oblique Strategies, and Tarot I
            suppose to. They're a nice container, tactile point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Are there good connections to computers? I think punch cards doesn't
            directly apply. Solitaire is a computer classic, for whatever
            reason. That infinite card animation would be fun to play with.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do think a big part of the card appeal to me, which has been a
            theme for me lately, is making stuff feel contained, manageable,
            understandable. Instead of thinking about something with every
            possibility available, it is constrained. It'd even be fun to pick
            out decks with specific angles, though the idea you're going to want
            to assemble multiple decks is maybe over-ambitious - maybe automate
            that part too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's try Linus's angle on this - the microscope lets you see the
            strands that make up an idea, more like DNA. It does feel similar.
            The card base makes it feel more manageable to me, but there may be
            biology tools and visualizations and metaphors that offer something
            else.
