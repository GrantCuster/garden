            <a href="https://sift.constraint.systems">Sift</a> is an
            experimental image editor that slices an image into layers. You can
            offset the layers to produce interference patterns and pseudo-3D
            effects. It uses an additive blending mode and pixel-based light
            splitting algorithm.
          </p>
          <h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
          <p>
            I started planning Sift while standing in the ocean, thinking about
            waves and how to use a wave effect on the pixels of an image. I've
            gotten used to thinking of images as a grid of pixels, and I've done
            some experiments using HTML canvas and javascript to move, or even
            flow, pixels around. I started trying to imagine how pixels could
            cycle "below the surface" and then pop up on top.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a wave effect I needed pixel depth. I needed to figure out a way
            to transform an array of pixels from 2D into 3D. I thought about RGB
            values. Coud I use the color value as the third dimension by using
            it to make a pixel stack? What if for a pixel with a red value of
            100 I stacked 100 red pixels?
          </p>
          <p>
            I ended up using the pixel stack idea (and cutting the wave idea,
            for now), but I had to get the right blending mode and slicing
            algorithm to get things working.
          </p>
          <h2 id="slicing-colors">Slicing colors</h2>
          <p>
            One of the issues with making pixel-specific stacks was that a pixel
            doesn't have just one color value, it has three (red, green, and
            blue). I decided to put the "brightest combo" at the top. So for an
            RGB value of <code>[10,16,24]</code> I would start the stack with 10
            <code>[1,1,1]</code> pixels. Then <code>16 - 10 = 6</code> for 6
            <code>[0,1,1]</code> pixels, and, finally,
            <code>24 - 16 = 8</code> for 8 <code>[0,0,1]</code> pixels. This
            means the white-ish pixels are on top, and then, as those are
            finished, you see a kind of exhaust trail of color.
          </p>
          <p>
            (For performance reasons, the finished app bins values according to
            the number of layers. So instead of 192 stacked
            <code>[1,1,1]</code> pixels for a <code>[192,192,192]</code> value,
            a 16 layer edit in Sift bins <code>192 / 16 = 12</code>, for 12
            <code>[16,16,16]</code> pixels.)

              Overlapping red, green, and blue squares in additive blend mode.

          </figure>
          <p>
            The color slicing only works with right blend mode, where each
            layer's RGB value is added together. For canvas, the blend setting
            is called <code>globalCompositeOperation</code> and the value for
            additive blending is <code>lighter</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additive blending, while not what I'm used to working with for
            computers, is actually how our eyes perceive light. I vaguely knew
            this, but it's been fun to play with it in the app and get a real
            feel for the consequences.
          </p>
          <h2 id="layers-and-offsets">Layers and offsets</h2>
          <p>
            Originally, I thought I'd build this app in Three.js, where you
            could rotate around the pixel (actually voxel) stacks in 3D. I
            thought maybe I could get the perspective such that it appeared a
            whole image at the start, but as you zoomed in you could see cracks
            between. I'm still not totally sure if the math for that could be
            worked out. But I quickly ran into performance issues from trying to
            render even binned values for every pixel in an image, so I switched
            over to HTML canvas. (I'm sure there are ways to do this in
            Three.js, possibly utilizing shaders? If you have ideas let me
            know.)
          </p>
          <p>
            I knew performance might be a struggle in canvas as well, but I had
            a plan. I know canvas can redraw image files (with
            <code>drawImage()</code>) quickly. On image load I split the image
            into a set number of layers (16 by default), doing all the bin
            calculations. The render function (peformed whenever the x and y
            offsets are changed) then just draws those layer images on top of
            one another and the blend mode takes care of the rest.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sometimes I have specific goals for
            <a href="https://constraint.systems">Constraint Systems</a>
            projects, other times I just follow an effect to its end. Other than
            the "stack" idea, I didn't really have a goal for what Sift should
            make images into. I was pleasantly surprised by the early results,
            right after I flipped the blend mode switch. For certain images, it
            produces a pseudo-3d effect.
            <a href="https://twitter.com/the_ezekiel/status/1299095952339410945"
              >Ezekial suggested it's like an aerogel</a
            >. It is also kind of like badly calibrated color separation in a TV
            (but different because of how it is stacked). Other images you can
            get kind of an otherwordly thing. I watched
            <em>Twin Peaks: The Return</em> recently and it reminded of me some
            of the face distortions from that.

          <h2 id="future-experiments">Future experiments</h2>
          <p>
            I'm definitely intrigued by the possibilities of additive blending.
            Partly due to
            <a href="https://twitter.com/tylerangert/status/1299163673424879617"
              >Tyler's suggestion</a
            >, I want to try layering video frames on top of each other using a
            similar process.
          </p>
          <h2 id="larger-goals">Larger goals</h2>
          <p>
            One of the goals of the Constraint Systems projects is to get really
            used to thinking of images as a collection of pixels, and work "with
            the grain" of how computers store images. I think the stacking and
            layer ideas are good signs that that part of the project is working.
            My intuition for what might produce interesting image results has
            gotten better. The mix of having a good idea of what I wanted but
            not being sure of the final effect is a fun one -- it feels like a
            collaboration with the computer.
