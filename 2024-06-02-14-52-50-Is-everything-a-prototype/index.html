            Prototypes should look like prototypes
          </h2>
          <p>
            Prototypes shouldn't look too nice. They should look like a
            work-in-progress. They should
            <a href="/2024-05-31-07-16-31-Carving-at-the-joints/"
              >show their joints</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            This keeps discussion at the right level of abstraction. You want to
            be talking about the capability, not the color scheme.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also invites others to extend and modify the prototype in their
            mind. It encourages iteration.

          <h2 id="but-then...">But then...</h2>

            I believe in and make these arguments. But then as I make the case,
            I start to question, what work shouldn't have these qualities?
          </p>
          <p>
            Shouldn't we always invite understanding and potential modification?
          </p>
          <p>Should everything be a prototype? Is everything a prototype?</p>
          <p>
            I think this connects to that Steve Jobs quote about the empowerment
            of understanding everything in the built world was designed by
            someone, and you can do it too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Qualities that might be in conflict with prototypey-ness are
            durability and safety. Important things!
          </p>
          <p>
            But I think a lot of objects aspire to a feeling of 'completeness'
            that is uneccesary. They want to conceal evidence of their
            construction. I want to show it.
