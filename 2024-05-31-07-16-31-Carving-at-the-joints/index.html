        <p>
          I've always liked building systems where the joints are visible:
          legos, Minecraft. Lately I've been thinking about the process of
          learning how to find the joints in systems where they're less visible.
          Of 'carving at the joints'.

        <h2 id="the-concept">The concept</h2>
        <p>
          Apparently Plato talked about "carving nature at the joints". I think
          my recent reference is the show Delicious in Dungeon, where they
          explain how to cut and prepare dungeon monsters into unlikely meals.
          The show has a lot of fun with the instructions reveal, where
          something that looks inedible is made appetizing through a precise set
          of steps.

          Joints are opportunities for you to modify, to splice in or switch
          parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been thinking about this with electronics. Compared to something
          like woodworking, electronics seems harder to tell where the joints
          are. But as you try a few projects, and watch the YouTube DIY
          examples, you start to see. Almost like x-ray vision.

        <p>
          For computer projects you can start with the components that are
          actually sold separately. Screen, computer, battery, keyboard and
          mouse. I've got a kind of portable cyberdeck going now with a Mini PC,
          a battery, a set of AR glasses and a keyboard. A laptop broken into
          it's parts and rearranged.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've also partially disassembled some laptops, removing a broken
          display and instead routing it to a monitor for a 'headless' laptop.
          I've accidently disconnected the Wifi antenna and needed to add it
          back in -- a process which makes more concrete to me the wifi antenna
          as a piece of tech.

        <h2 id="carving-up-ai">Carving up AI</h2>
        <p>
          I like the idea of 'looking for the joints' when I approach any
          system. I've been thinking about this even with AI model experiments.
          Models are a weird set of capabilities, I want to find the right set
          of capabilities and splice them together with other software pieces to
          make the creative experiences I'm after.
