            Screenshot vs artwork: games vs creative tools
          </h1>
          <p>
            I take a lot of inspiration from video games but I want to make
            creative tools. What's the difference between a game and a creative
            tool?
          </p>
          <p>
            One big difference seems to be the end goal: with a creative tool
            you make something you want to share outside of the tool. You export
            something, often an image or a text document. In a game, you're
            normally working within the game world. Often you're completing
            quests. For more creation-oriented games like Minecraft, you're
            building something and you may even share your creation in the form
            of screenshots or recordings, but still there's a sense that what
            you made belongs in the game world and is best experienced there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another big difference is primitives. In drawing and painting
            applications, you're often working at a pretty low-level, defining
            shapes and colors and paths. In games, you're often acting within a
            world using an avatar. It's more like making scenes with dolls and
            action figures (or in Minecraft's case, legos) than it is painting
            or drawing. The distinction seems to carry over pretty cleanly from
            the physical world. 3D graphics programs or game development tools
            like Unity possibly make things a little fuzzier, but even there I
            think the distinction between playing and creating can mostly be
            classified according to what level you're intervening at.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's something of the idea of ownership in there as well. I know
            there's been some work done in taking artistically composed
            screenshots of games. That feels like more of a collaboration to me,
            between the game creators and the artist staging the photos, versus
            an independent creative work. I know I'm not being technically
            rigorous in how I define this stuff, and there's probably lots of
            great work that blurs and interrogates this kind of thing. I'm
            trying to write out my general feelings about the differences even
            if they're not totally consistent or well-reasoned.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm interested in something like: 'what does Minecraft look like if
            you can bring in your own blocks'? I know there's a modding scene
            that gets at some of this, I did a little bit of work creating my
            own skins for games I played when I was yonger. It was kind of
            thrilling opening up and modifying the game files, seeing that it
            was all pieces put together. But yea, what if there was something
            where you could bring in things from the outside world (images)
            modify them in a 'game-like' manner, with the goal being an output
            (an image) that could go elsewhere (and that could feel whole into
            itself, not like a 'screenshot of a game')? Would that feel like a
            'creative tool'? Is it mostly a manner of framing? Can you use a
            bunch of game mechanics (and yes, I should be more concrete here,
            but later) in a creative tool just by making sure that those import
            and export actions are positioned as the main goal? Maybe?
