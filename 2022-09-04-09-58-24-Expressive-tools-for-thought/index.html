        <h1 id="expressive-tools-for-thought">Expressive tools for thought</h1>
        <p>
          I'm excited for all the energy around tools for thought. Some notes on
          my current thoughts (probably to be revised in future entries).
        </p>
        <h2 id="blocks-as-the-basic-unit">Blocks as the basic unit</h2>
        <p>
          Blocks as a basic, contained, and usually addressable unit feels to me
          "right". You can see it in Notion and Roam and many others.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think the collapsible block (block that can have children) is also
          an essential piece as well. This is in Roam and Logseq (and
          Workflowy!). It's not in Notion or Obsidian as the default, and I miss
          it there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The nested block structure makes a tree. I think one of the best parts
          of the tree structure is how it lends itself to restructuring. Move
          the top-level item and you move the children along with it. You can
          organize your writing at the top-level, or you can drill down into an
          item and reorganize within that. That feels right to me. It's notecard
          reorg, but even more flexible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trees are exclusively hiererchical and sometime relationships are not.
          This is where hyperlinks come in. And Roam did a great job of showing
          the possibilities here, with instant create and backlinks. With links
          + nested blocks you can have hierchical structure while also making
          these associative jumps. This seems like the right mix. I'm not sure
          we've cracked the best way to present it yet, I still get stressed
          trying to make sure I figure out the right link/category naming
          conventions.
        </p>
        <h2 id="blocks-as-individually-addressable">
          Blocks as individually addressable
        </h2>
        <p>
          Connected to this is the possibility of addressing indivdual blocks,
          whether creating links or something more like transclusion. Nested
          blocks plus addressing blocks seems to me the closest we've got to the
          promis of "what computers are good at" being marshalled for our own
          ends.
        </p>
        <h3 id="naming">Naming</h3>
        <p>
          Technically, the individually addressable blocks are interesting. The
          way I know to do it is to assign each one a uuid, which can be created
          in isolation with a strong guarantee that it won't collide with other
          individually created ids. This is cool. It helps with mutliplayer, it
          helps with simplified/contained creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          With uuids we can have guaranteed unique ideas for all your bullet
          points.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we've still got a naming issue. How do you refer to a block when
          you link to it? The uuid does not exactly stick in the mind. But it's
          also too much of a burden to ask you to name or tag each one of your
          bullet pointss. Use a section of the text maybe? Or bring up some
          fuzzy search interface that makes the linking easy -- still it's
          difficult to zero in on what in that bullet is useful important (say
          you wanted a zoomed out structural view, for example). Maybe machine
          learning bassed summarization helps here.
        </p>
        <h2 id="expressiveness">Expressiveness</h2>
        <p>
          My current hot-take is that expressing yourself is intertwined with
          thinking, and none of the tools so far have paid enough attention to
          this aspect. I'm fascinated by the aesthetic college class notes
          culture around Notion, but I also find Notion's rules so limiting in
          expressiveness. Especially compared to the "older web" where I most
          often think of tumblr and how much room to make a genuinely unique
          blog structure there was (combined, interestingly, with the guardrails
          of the feed).
        </p>
        <h3 id="website-builders">Website-builders</h3>
        <p>
          I think expressivity has been under-addresssed. I also think html and
          CSS have advanced to the point where we can give users a subset
