          I would say this garden has been a relative success in terms of
          helping me write more. I kind of want to combine it with my feed, and
          maybe my homepage?
        </p>
        <p>
          Feed would be the thing to do first I think. It's interesting trying
          to categorize the differences between posts. Garden is more writing
          based. Feed is structured around an image. Feed was designed to make
          sure I wasn't blocked trying to think of a title, that I could do more
          work-in-progress stuff. Maybe that's different now that garden is
          here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall I want to keep things simple. But I also want to have some
          fun. I'm pretty confindent I can figure out ways to do what I want,
          and as long as I keep the file format relatively stable, markdown for
          garden and a common structure for feed, I think I can do it without
          really risking anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started work on an image uploader, I think I want one that will just
          run locally and let me easily drop in images and get a public storage
          bucket address to link to. I kind of did that before for the writing
          app and it's worked well.
        </p>
        <p>
          I guess one question is how to interleave garden and feed posts.
          Garden is static-based files right now, feed is a DB. I wonder if I
          would ever try and migrate feed to file based. There are quite a few
          posts in there, but if it's just the text it'd be pretty light, and I
          could build without too much trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what do I want it to feel like? I want it to feel alive. I want it
          to feel like the twitter feed of my profile but better. It could
          almost be its own mastodon feed I guess... But then I kind of like the
          idea of this standing on its own and then social being linked in.
        </p>
        <p>
          It'd be cool to build your own threads too. Hmmm that kind of makes me
          want to build something like Twitter, but maybe friendlier to long
          text posts. Hmmm why not do that.
        </p>
        <p>
          A thread focused blog... hmmm. Or would that just be overkill in terms
          of complexity. I wonder if I could tie that in with the garden
          metaphor in a way that doesn't feel too forced. Going to think about
          that one.
