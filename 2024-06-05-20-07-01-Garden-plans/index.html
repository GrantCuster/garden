            I would say this garden has been a relative success in terms of
            helping me write more. I kind of want to combine it with my feed,
            and maybe my homepage?
          </p>
          <p>
            Feed would be the thing to do first I think. It's interesting trying
            to categorize the differences between posts. Garden is more writing
            based. Feed is structured around an image. Feed was designed to make
            sure I wasn't blocked trying to think of a title, that I could do
            more work-in-progress stuff. Maybe that's different now that garden
            is here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall I want to keep things simple. But I also want to have some
            fun. I'm pretty confindent I can figure out ways to do what I want,
            and as long as I keep the file format relatively stable, markdown
            for garden and a common structure for feed, I think I can do it
            without really risking anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started work on an image uploader, I think I want one that will
            just run locally and let me easily drop in images and get a public
            storage bucket address to link to. I kind of did that before for the
            writing app and it's worked well.
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess one question is how to interleave garden and feed posts.
            Garden is static-based files right now, feed is a DB. I wonder if I
            would ever try and migrate feed to file based. There are quite a few
            posts in there, but if it's just the text it'd be pretty light, and
            I could build without too much trouble.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what do I want it to feel like? I want it to feel alive. I want
            it to feel like the twitter feed of my profile but better. It could
            almost be its own mastodon feed I guess... But then I kind of like
            the idea of this standing on its own and then social being linked
            in.
          </p>
          <p>
            It'd be cool to build your own threads too. Hmmm that kind of makes
            me want to build something like Twitter, but maybe friendlier to
            long text posts. Hmmm why not do that.
          </p>
          <p>
            A thread focused blog... hmmm. Or would that just be overkill in
            terms of complexity. I wonder if I could tie that in with the garden
            metaphor in a way that doesn't feel too forced. Going to think about
            that one.
