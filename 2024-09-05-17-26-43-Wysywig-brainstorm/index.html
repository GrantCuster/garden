            Demo that has some promise where all data is in the image file.
            Sources on the left, canvas layout on the top right. Data encoded as
            image pixels on the bottom right.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I'm not excited to jump back into it lately so I need to figure
            something out.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think it gets more interesting when I have the three ways of
            working with the images.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The first way is like they're... images, the destination has them
              as movable, resizable boxes.
            </li>
            <li>
              The second way is like text. You have keybindings that print the
              image, and move you to the next square. One undecide piece here is
              are their text blocks? That complicates things, right? For their
              to be text blocks - maybe simplifies some things too, maybe they
              work kind of like they did in Sprout. Expanding out horizontally
              at first, to some max width then moving down. What is that data
              structure? Each char belongs to the text block... But that could
              also help explain why text gets laid out differently. It's not
              text that does, it's anything in this block. It's a layout in a
              block yea...
            </li>
            <li>
              The third way is paint, makes most sense with colors you could
              click and drag to print the same image... I guess like chars, a
              big part of the paint being useful is it should be able to break
              out of the box clumps - that's why you use it for something like
              annotation on top of other pieces. Maybe you group it together as
              you paint - i've done that before too.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            But then it's more like a conventional image editor app. Maybe
            that's fine. I"ve tried to avoid layers before, hmmm...
