            What if I made a blog like this blog but also more like Twitter.
            Where I could make little posts, or I could also reply to old posts,
            bumping that 'thread' of posts to the top. But (like Twitter) it
            would show the update, with an indication and ability to click
            through to see the full thread.
          </p>
          <p>
            That seems kind of cool? Like it'd be good for long-running thoughts
            I keep returning to and also for WIP posts...

            Maybe structuring stuff in the code gets weird, but it's going to be
            small-scale so I think I could figure something out. I think I'd
            just do markdown files with like a link at the top, and use the
            filename for the date slug like I've been doing. I would still like
            titles I think. But maybe that's just otional.
