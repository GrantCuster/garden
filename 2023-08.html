                  >Edit: There are credible reports that
                  suckless/folks-involved-with-suckless engage with
                  right-wing/neo-facist/nazi views. Views I completely reject.
                  I've never been involved in the community, and tracking down
                  what has happened is difficult from the outside,
                  <a href="https://tilde.team/~ben/suckmore/">this</a> seems
                  like a good collection, albeit with link rot. But I've
                  definitely seen a neo-fascist streak (often positioned as
                  trolling) on linux youtube content and want to be clear I do
                  not support any of that, and advise anyone entering into the
                  linux community to stay away from that ideology, there's lots
                  of folks (by far the majority) interested in software
                  customization without those views.</em

                <a href="https://suckless.org/">suckless</a> is a set of
                opinionated Linux software focused on simplicity and targeted
                towards experienced users. The most interesting part of the
                project to me is the attempt to break down the most common
                programs into a set of shareable primitives.

                I've been working on building a task-focused operating system.
                Really it's more like a presentational wrapper on top of a bunch
                of Linux tools. You can see the configuration at
