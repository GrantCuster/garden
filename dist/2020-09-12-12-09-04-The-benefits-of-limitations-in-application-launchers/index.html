            In my Linux set-up, I use dmenu as an application launcher. dmenu is
            basically autocomplete for applications and scripts. In many ways,
            it's not so different from launching things using Spotlight on a
            Mac.

            Since I started using it, dmenu has been a convenient way to launch
            apps. But I've only recently started to realize some of the
            interesting things it makes possible. A lot of the possibilities
            come down to the limitations of the interface, and how agnostic it
            is about what it launches.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lately, I've started putting scripts to run apps, or a combination
            of apps, or a combination of apps and websites and terminals, in my
            <code>.local/bin</code> folder where they are exposed through dmenu.
            Some of the things I've added:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>planner</code> launches my calendar, personal email, and
              work email all in different firefox windows.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>750words</code> launches https://750words.com/ in a new
              firefox window.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>blog</code> launches a terminal set to my blog directory, a
              terminal window running <code>npm run dev</code> to run the local
              versions, and a firefox window open to localhost.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>record</code> starts a screen recording.
              <code>gif_2x</code> converts the last screen recording into a GIF
              running at 2x speed. When it's done it opens a window showing the
              GIF and listing the file size.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Some of these are rather involved scripts, some are very simple.
            What I've been surprised by is how different even the simple ones
            feel when launched from the application launcher. Something like
            <code>750words</code> is given its own space and weight as an
            activity, promoted from being a website I visit among other
            websites. It also makes my intention going in very clear, if I open
            <code>750words</code> my intention is to do it, versus getting lost
            browsing (even though, functionally, all it is doing is opening
            <code>750words</code> in a web browser).
          </p>

            I used to go after the same effect on macOS, especially for web
            applications. There were several programs that would let you run a
            website within its own application container. That meant you could
            launch it from Spotlight. There were always rough edges that made
            clear it was a bit of a hack though. The difference between the
            wrapped web apps and the true apps was noticeable. This is partly
            because apps on macOS are expected to be polished, with their own
            nice-looking icon.

              >The lesson I'm interested in with dmenu, is how the limitations
              (an application is only a name among names) make it much easier
              and more satisfying to add user-configured applications and
              scripts.</strong

            I am surprised by how different it feels to have my scripts sit
            right alongside the other applications. As with my experience of
            lots of Linux-related stuff, it is a feeling of empowerment. It
            feels like a level of customization above what I'm used to, computer
            as tool I am control of, rather than something I'm wrestling with.

            I've noticed a similar effect in making websites. Often you end up
            making a website that you want to display a preview of on another
            website. I do this on
            <a href="https://constraint.systems">Constraint Systems</a> and for
            the
            <a href="https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/prototypes"
              >Cloudera Fast Forward prototypes</a
            >. Through experience, I've learned you want to make the number of
            assets needed for the list preview as few as possible. In the case
            of Constraint Systems, it is a tile, a description, a preview image,
            and a preview GIF. It is tempting to require more elements (like
            several preview images) to provide a fancier preview. Whatever you
            require, however, you're going to have to provide for every link
            going forward. A surprising amount of friction can come from needing
            to create preview assets (and also the deploy process for those
            assets). Enough friction to cause you to make fewer tools or blog
            posts because you're dreading that part of the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Website meta tags have been an interesting development in relation
            to this. Used for creating previews on shared Twitter and Facebook
            links, the main meta tags are limited enough (title, description,
            preview image) that they're worth doing, and now that they're being
            regularly done across sites, even more services can dependably use
            them to unfurl links.
