        <p>
          This site is a bash build script that concats HTML together. I also
          put together a little start script using fzf that has some common task
          options new_post / build / commit. I really like the feel of the
          starting bash script - it makes it feel like writing in this blog is
          its own little dedicated computer program.
        </p>
        <p>
          The source for this one is viewable
          <a href="https://github.com/GrantCuster/garden">on github</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I'm going to try a new blog concept (a continuation of
          <a href="/2024-06-05-20-27-27-Thread-focused-blog-idea/"
            >the thread-focused blog idea</a
          >), that combines what I do on
          <a href="https://feed.grantcuster.com">feed</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Restarting is maybe a bit risky, since I think I have about three
          blog-like things I've made over the past few years, and this one I'm
          at least writing in. I resolved to keep writing in this one until the
          next one's real.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm hopeful the new one will get going though. I'd really like these
          kinds of posts to live next to lighter-weight screenshot + gif posts.
          I feel like I have good sense of how to keep the pieces relatively
          simple, and as long as I stick to well-trod ground for a lot of the
          pieces I can get decent AI generated code for a lot of it. Then I can
          hopefully splice and stitch that together into a lively little
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far I made an image uploader for s3, when some auto-resizing
          capabilities built-in. One of the downsides of when I used to have a
          static blog on github pages was how, over time, the images did come to
          dominate the repo size. I want to split out that chunk, wrap it up,
          and plug it in where I need it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I (with ChatGPT assistance) got the uploader tool up on a password
          protected subdomain, being served through a droplet. Even did the
          nginx reverse proxy with SSL and feel like I pretty much understand
          how it's all working.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically want to put together a bunch of little web tool capabilities
          for myself and then start putting them together. Keeping the pieces
          big and blocky so they can be torn down or replaced or reconfigured.
