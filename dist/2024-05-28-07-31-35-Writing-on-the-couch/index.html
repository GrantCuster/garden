        <p>
          Trying to keep up the habit of quick writing in here. Now morning
          writing from the couch, the dog beside me, the baby exploring a
          cardboard box. A nice spring-like morning.

          Did some organizing syncing the setups yesterday. Still liking the
          Ubuntu + Nix configuration. Getting better and faster about keeping it
          up to date across the laptop and the mini PC. The server's a bit
          behind.

          For the glassese set-up I got audio and bluetooth working yesterday,
          so I think everything I wanted to do with that thing is proved out. I
          ordered a cross-body bag that I hope will fit everything well. Porch
          use has been good so far, interested in trying a commute with it. The
          battery pack has been working well, I'm surprised how much having an
          exact percent readout, rather than something like 4 lights, helps me
          feel secure about power draw.

          I want to get clipboard history sorted today. Also want to make the
          nice gif recording set up with a notification in the top bar.
