                I'm possibly in the midst of revising a bunch of my assumptions
                about how I like to code projects, so I wanted to write down my
                current thoughts. I'm probably in a honeymoon phase with the new
                set-up, so it's possible as I work longer I'll run into a bunch
                of walls and complications and end up re-revising.

                Get a storefront, split it into a front half and a back half.
                Put six computers in each half. The front half is free for
                anyone to come and use. The catch is that the free-to-use
                computers only run the software made in the lab by the
                in-residence developers that work in the back half.

                Screenshot vs artwork: games vs creative tools
              </h1>
              <p>
                I take a lot of inspiration from video games but I want to make
                creative tools. What's the difference between a game and a
                creative tool?
              </p>
              <p>
                One big difference seems to be the end goal: with a creative
                tool you make something you want to share outside of the tool.
                You export something, often an image or a text document. In a
                game, you're normally working within the game world. Often
                you're completing quests. For more creation-oriented games like
                Minecraft, you're building something and you may even share your
                creation in the form of screenshots or recordings, but still
                there's a sense that what you made belongs in the game world and
                is best experienced there.

                  okay, to start, an analogy: long ago, a single person could
                  build the best video game that existed. Adventure didn't
                  require 200 developers and 18 months to get out the door. as
                  technology improved, so did expectations. Adventure was my
                  goal. Today's kids' goal is fortnite. â€”<a
