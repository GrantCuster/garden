            Bushido Blade 2 was a Playstation game I played a lot in high
            school. It was a fighting game with swords, and its main hook was
            that instead of health bars, damage was based on where you struck
            your opponent. You could injure limbs or finish the an opponent with
            one strike if you hit the right spot.

          <p>
            Design-wise, Bushido Blade rethought the premise of a fighting game
            from first principles. I love what this approach allowed them to do
            in terms of immersion: during a fight, nothing is visible on the
            screen except the two characters.
          </p>

            This is what I want to do when I design something: communicate
            everything through the core action. Design things so well that you
            don't need to bring in health bars and labels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bushido Blade 2, like most of the games I played, was well-reviewed
            but never really that popular. I remember it having a pretty good
            story-mode with fun voice acting.
