            >, by Zach Gage, on how genre conventions serve as interaction
            shortcuts, got me thinking about how I use Vim conventions in my

              7/ A big part of making games involves working with genre
              literacy. In game design a key concept is the idea of weight:
              Every rule you add has a cognitive load on the player, and you
              must balance the weight of your rules against how meaningful they
              are to the play experience.

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              8/ An idea might be great, but if it makes the game unwieldy,
              ditch it. But genre-conventions are different -- they're
              weightless. They allow for an increased complexity and nuance in
              games, because they let designers include a huge number of rules
              without adding any weight.

            Almost all of the experiments on Constraint Systems use Vim
            conventions: at least the <code>hjkl</code> characters for movement.
            One of the big reasons I started the experiments was my fascination
            with how I felt using Vim in the terminal. The combination of a
            strict character grid and keyboard controls provide a feeling of
            stability, and through that calm, that I don't feel in other
            programs, or using a computer in general.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was especially in contrast to how I've felt when making
            gestural interface, or ones that simulate physics. Building those
            often felt like piling on edge-case handler on top of edge-case
            handler. If you did it well you could make a pleasing user
            experience, as long as they stuck to the path you had prepared. If
            they wanted to go a different direction, or you wanted to take the
            program in a new direction, you had to deal with that unwieldy
            tower, either by rearchitecting it or by adding even more code for
            handling the new edge cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to strip things down, and see if I could start from a more
            stable foundations, and I turned to Vim conventions to do that. It
            was a natural choice because I was chasing that feeling from Vim.
            Choosing Vim also gave me the interaction bootstrapping effect that
            Zach is talking about. Rather than asking the user to start from
            interaction scratch, I had the Vim foundation. That's not directly
            relevant for the majority of people, Vim is only used a subset of
            programmers, so it doesn't solve everything, but it is a place to
            start.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even for users not familiar with Vim conventions, I think there's a
            benefit to starting the experiments there, rather than trying to
            introduce a new paradigm. Vim has proven itself to at least be
            useful to many people (and inspired a lot of loyalty). So there's an
            implicit promise that even if this looks weird, you know it can be
            learned and at least some people have found it useful.

            There's a whole series of
            <a
              href="https://reversed.top/2016-08-13/big-list-of-vim-like-software/"
              >Vim-like programs</a
            >, mostly terminal-based, that use similar key combinations. There's
            also a number of browser extensions that let you
            <a

              >use Vim keybindings in the browser</a
            >. Tiling window managers (I use
            <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3wm</a>) also share a lot of
            conventions. Putting these all together, you can put together a
            system for daily use that is keyboard-focused and mostly Vim-based.
            I've started referring to the Constraint Systems experiments as
            "alternative" interfaces. Vimlike interfaces are arguably the
            longest running, most fully fleshed out alternative interface for
            computers. I want to add to and learn from that system, and keep it
            alive in the face of the conventions (often imported from
            mobile/touchscreen design) that are dominating today.
