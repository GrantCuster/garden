            I was writing a lot and then I decided I needed to redo the blog and
            then I thought I can't write more until I finish redoing the blog
            and so I wasn't writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I pushed this version. It's more like Twitter, with individual
            entries and also the ability to thread. There are some unaswered
            questions (like pagination). I also can't decide if I should move
            all my feed posts in here. They might overwhelm the writing posts,
            but I think I'd like to figure out a way everything can live
            together.
          </p>

            I changed from bash scripts to typescript scripts, which has been
            helpful for organization. It's going well but I can also feel it in
            danger of sprawling out of what I can hold in my head -- and I feel
            like that is dangerous for solo projects, it's where it starts
            getting harder to jump back in and tinker. I should think about
            consolidating and carving up the pieces to make it easier to work on
            pieces at a time without feeling the stress that the whole thing
            might break.
