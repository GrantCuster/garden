          <p>
            I'm having trouble pairing my wireless keyboard with my mini PC. I
            keep trying new things and searching the proglem in different
            combos.
          </p>
          <p>
            My current theory is maybe the bluetooth driver isn't up to date
            enough? But I think it actually may be.
          </p>
          <p>
            The haunting thing is maybe it's just a bad state issue, and if I
            reset the right thing (firmware on the keyboard, bluetooth status on
            the keyboard) it will be all fixed up.
          </p>
          <p>
            I should leave it. I have other things to do. It can sit. I can use
            the keyboard in wired mode with the mini PC and it works fine.
          </p>
          <p>
            But every time I step away I think "well maybe..." and I have a
            strong urge to try something slightly different.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think this general pattern has probably served me well in many
            computer and life things and badly in others. I'm going to do some
            chores now, but I also want to reflash the firmware.
