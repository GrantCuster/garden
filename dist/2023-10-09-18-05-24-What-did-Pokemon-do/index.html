          <p>
            Pokemon took the combat formula from traditional turn-based RPGs and
            turned it inside-out.
          </p>
          <p>
            In traditional RPGs you have a few characters who learn more and
            more attacks and spells.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Pokemon you capture more and more characters (pokemon) who can
            only have four moves each.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of choosing from a big list of attacks and spells, you
            choose from a list of Pokemon and then a small list of moves.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm interested in the shift from "few characters, many moves" to
            "many characters, few moves each" as a design move that could be
            useful to apply to interfaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many traditional RPGs (I've been playing Chrono Trigger) are
            recognized as some of the best videogames ever made, but they don't
            rival pokemon in popularity.
          </p>
          <p>
            How much can you put that difference down to the shift in combat?
            There are definitely some other, related aspects:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Capturing means regular battles are now opportunities to create
              more characters. Regular battles are the grindiest aspects of RPGs
              so this seems like a big deal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Evolution mechanics tap into people's interest in digital pets.
            </li>
          </ul>
