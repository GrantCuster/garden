          <p>How do you change things?</p>
          <p>
            I'm interested in users having the ability to personalize websites.
            I've mainly thought about it as a case for UI that lets you choose
            different options, probably powered by CSS (see components.ai's
            <a href="https://components.ai/css-gui">CSS.GUI</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            My
            <a href="https://css-paint.constraint.systems">CSS Paint</a> project
            lets you use a brush. It's interesting to use a brush. Should we let
            people style their website using a brush to paint styles on to divs?
          </p>
          <p>
            What out there is like a brush? There is the browser dev tools'
            element picker. The element picker is almost like a 2-step brush
            where you first select the element and then you edit it by way of
            CSS. With a brush you set the CSS then you target the elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The advantage of a brush over an element picker or indivdual panel
            approach is that you could apply it to more elements quickly.
            Possibly the painting approach puts you in a different mode, less
            structural, more expressive. Maybe a combo would be best. You
            structurally build a house and then you expressively paint the
            walls. Paint a little, sit back and consider, paint a little more.
          </p>

          <p>
            If I think about being able to "paint divs" to style a website one
            practical consideration is that, sometimes, divs are on top of other
            divs, or their boundaries are not obvious. In that case painting may
            have uninteneded effects. It'd be interesting to try and make a tool
            where divs always have to have a little padding, as an affordance to
            be targeted. You could also probably address this by using some of
            the tools vector tools like Figma use to target different stacked
            elements, although that would takes away from the simplicity I
            think.
          </p>
          <h3 id="layout-shifts">Layout shifts</h3>
          <p>
            CSS does such a wide range of things, some of them, like changing
            layout, when applied directly with a brush may be jarring in their
            results. Maybe you need to limit some of the properties, or maybe
            you can add hints to the transformations (or even some sort of diff
            view?) that make what's happening more apparent.

            Connections to atomic CSS / Tailwind

          <p>
            I've been loving using
            <a href="https://tailwind.css">tailwind</a> for styles lately, which
            has some things in common with a brush approach in that you have
            this wide, but not infinite, set of styles you can choose from, like
            a palette. I wonder if brush plus tailwind could be a good fit.
            Prehaps another prototype.
