            I've been working on building a task-focused operating system.
            Really it's more like a presentational wrapper on top of a bunch of
            Linux tools. You can see the configuration at
            <a
              href="https://github.com/GrantCuster/nix/tree/6e365d778b732395b8eb3968e9e70075f342a486"

          <h2 id="the-idea">The idea</h2>
          <p>
            The main idea is to have a separate workspace for each task.
            Workspaces are displayed on the home dashboard (accessed through
            Command+Tab). The workspace list is set-up similar to a command
            pallete: focused on being fast and keyboard-usable. Recently viewed
            spaces are at the top, typing filters them live, and hitting return
            selects the top one. You can create a new workspace directly from
            the filter input.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently workspaces themselves are pretty minimal. The workspace
            name is at the top left and the time at the top right. Application
            windows are tiled.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="https://grant-uploader.s3.amazonaws.com/2024-08-23-18-01-22-2000.jpg"
              alt="The workspace for writing this blog post"
            />
            <figcaption aria-hidden="true">
              The workspace for writing this blog post
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The goal is to stay focused on one task at a time. I've found just
            the step of having the task name in the bar to be surprisingly
            effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            One piece that makes this work is that most of my applications are
            either terminals or browsers. I'm quite happy to open multiple new
            terminals and browsers for each workspace. This keeps the workspaces
            self-contained (no need to flip back to refer to something in the
            browser in another space, just open a new browser window).
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Operating system: Linux</li>
            <li>
              Distribution: <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a> is an attempt
              to make your system set-up a lot more reproducible. It's not
              really essential to what I'm doing in my set-up, but hopefully it
              will make it easier to maintain and branch. Most of my config is
              in
              <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager"
                >home-manager</a
              >
              rather than the system config.
            </li>
            <li>
              Window manager: <a href="https://hyprland.org/">Hyprland</a> is a
              relatively new tiling window manager and compositor. It's the
              basis for a lot of the customization I'm able to do on my set-up.
              The command-line controls available through
              <code>hyprctrl</code> are what allow me to make custom interfaces.
              It's really nice that it has a JSON output option that makes it
              super easy to display info like current workspaces.
            </li>
            <li>
              Window manager API:
              <a
                href="https://github.com/GrantCuster/nix/blob/main/home/home-ui/home-ui-server/server.mjs"
                >Node.js websocket server</a
              >. This is, I think, where I get a bit more unconventional. I use
              a local websocket server to provide an interface to local web apps
              to command and display info from Hyprland by way of shell scripts.
              I also use this to send the contents of specific files (like my
              task list) on updates. I've never run a websocket server before
              and I'm sure optimizations could be made.

              <a
                href="https://github.com/GrantCuster/nix/blob/main/home/home-ui/home-ui-homepage/src/App.tsx"
                >home dashboard</a
              >
              and
              <a
                href="https://github.com/GrantCuster/nix/blob/main/home/home-ui/home-ui-bar/src/App.tsx"
                >bar</a
              >: React web apps. Using the websocket server as a backend, I'm
              able to make both a custom home dashboard and bar in React. By
              displaying them in chrome with the <code>app=</code> command-line
              flag, and Hyprland defined minimal window decorations, I'm able to
              get rid of all the browser chrome, so they appear as stand-alone
              apps.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="why-react">Why React</h2>
          <p>
            Mainly because it's what I'm most familiar with and therefore can
            move the fastest and most surely in. There's also a pattern of apps
            like <a href="https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar">Waybar</a> adopting
            a subset of CSS for styling. Once I saw that and figured out the
            node.js to command-line piece, I thought why not just go all the way
            and get full access to HTML and CSS possibilities. My styling has
            stayed pretty minimalist so far, but there's obviously the potential
            to go much wilder with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main concerns are latency and performance. I don't think
            performance is going to be hurt by keeping a few more web pages
            open. Latency I do feel a bit on clicks. I can't imagine React is
            the bottle-neck there, though, and probably I can get better results
            by tweaking my websocket and shell-script set-up.
          </p>
          <h2 id="displaying-todos-and-screenshots">
            Displaying todos and screenshots
          </h2>
          <p>
            I show lists of todos and system ideas on the dashboard as well.
            These come from markdown files, I again use the websocket server to
            <code>cat</code> the file contents and then display those within
            React. I could/should use a markdown renderer, but my todo format is
            consistent enough I just parse it myself for now. I use
            <code>inotify</code> to watch for changes and update automatically.
            This seems like a really interesting pattern I'd like to experiment
            more with. Maybe make custom file watcher modules on the dashboard
            on-demand. In my case these files are also in my Obsidian vault, and
            since I have Obsidian sync I can get sync across my mobile devices
            too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Screenshot display is similar but I watch a directory. The ability
            to display images (or videos) exactly like I want them is a really
            nice feature of doing this with HTML, and something I'll continue to
            explore.
          </p>
          <h2 id="future-plans">Future plans</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Timers: the other big productivity and focus piece I want to get
              in is timers. I tried workspace timers but I think even that is a
              little inflexible. I think I want to make timers on demand as
              another custom web app. So that they can be workspace and task
              based or something else. I think I can also query across them to
              display a global view on the dashboard.
            </li>
            <li>
              Scheduled workspaces: I want workspaces to show up for rituals I
              intend to do each day (like freewrite) this is definitely
              possible, just need to do more thinking about how I want to
              organize it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Beyond tiling: I think having a task tied to one workspace works
              most of the time. But sometimes more windows than comfortably fit
              in the workspace are required. I can use the group and tabs
              feature for Hyprland to help with this, but I'm also interested in
              trying some scrolling workspace solutions, similar to
              <a href="https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM">PaperWM</a>. Hyprland
              isn't exactly built for this, but I have some ideas of how to
              programatically make it work. The stretch version of this is a
              spatial canvas set-up.
            </li>
            <li>
              Customizable dashboard: one thing I like about the current set-up
              is that modification is easy -- I just run a dev version of the
              home app and develop it as I would a regular app. I think I want
              to try and shift even more abilities to customize into the home
              app itself, so I can switch out components, or even create new
              ones from the dashboard interface itself. If I find the right
              primitives I think this is totally possible.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="let-me-know-what-you-think">Let me know what you think</h2>
          <p>
            I'm interested to hear from anyone doing similar experiments or what
            you would want if you were had your own customizable operating
            system.
