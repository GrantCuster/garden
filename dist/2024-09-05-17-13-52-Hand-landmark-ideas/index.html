          <p>Brainstorming on the train. Laying out the pieces.</p>
          <p>
            I can use mediapipe hand landmark. I know the positions of the
            fingers. I'll use pointer finger as cursor, if they have two hands
            up I can use both of them...
          </p>
          <p>
            I can use pointer and thumb pincer as click. I can normalize
            distance based on lower knuckle thumb distance probably. Click and
            drag works with that motion too, although maybe it's a shame you
            can't just point and drag - maybe also some ability to toggle based
            on the other hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            You could also try and distinguish point and drag from fist, so that
            raising one finger was the trigger - interesting you'd want to wait
            until it was fully raised though, probably need a little delay.
          </p>
          <p>
            Idea to use your hand to 'freeze pixels' in a webcam just by
            dragging across an area... Question of when your fingers are 'live'
            and active.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pixelate pixels by clicking, every click doubles the pixel area.
            That would actually work I think. I donder if I even grid it out in
            that case or just do it iteratively over the top... I think do it
            over the top but bigger pixels would overwrite smaller pixels. You'd
            want to set up pointerDown, pointerMove, pointerUp events, which
            would be fun in it's own right. And I guess you'd always track
            pointer as pointer... I think I'd need to chunk it up a bit though,
            because there's got to be some instability just sitting that there's
            not with a mouse or trackpad.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe that's a good first demo. Pointerdown, pointermove, pointerup.
            What do you do when a hand goes offscreen? I think you keep it down
            if it's down huh? Till it comes back not down.
          </p>
          <p>
            A bummer with webcam examples is I won't be able to write them on
            the train.
