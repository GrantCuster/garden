            It varies a lot day-to-day but I think it's safe to say I'm mildly
            stressed about the overall impact of AI. I've worked with machine
            learning for a long time now -- falling into with Fast Forward Labs
            ten years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            At their best, I think current developments encourage me to think
            about what I want -- out of work, out of computers. There's parts of
            some of my past work where I think the idea was part of what made it
            interesting to others, but also a big part was that I put in more
            work (as the Penn and Teller quote goes) than a reasonable person
            was willing too. The need to put in work in that specific way seems
            to be going away (the code could be generated instead).
          </p>
          <p>
            There's still places to put in the work:
            <a
              href="https://garden.grantcuster.com/2024-05-31-07-16-31-Carving-at-the-joints/"
              >carving the joints</a
            >
            is partly me trying to work that out. In figuring out how to put
            systems together, and the experience of that past work will aid in
            that... but it does feel like it will be different.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe part of it is just more career-based. Somewhere in my head I
            think I had software developer as relatively interesting work I
            could always fall back on. I don't think it's going away, but I
            don't think it will continue as it has been either.
          </p>

            Stopping for tonight but I want to keep exploring and drilling into
            this.
