        <p>
          Prototypes shouldn't look too nice. They should look like a
          work-in-progress. They should
          <a href="/2024-05-31-07-16-31-Carving-at-the-joints/"
            >show their joints</a

          This keeps discussion at the right level of abstraction. You want to
          be talking about the capability, not the color scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also invites others to extend and modify the prototype in their
          mind. It encourages iteration.

          I believe in and make these arguments. But then as I make the case, I
          start to question, what work shouldn't have these qualities?
        </p>
        <p>
          Shouldn't we always invite understanding and potential modification?
        </p>
        <p>Should everything be a prototype? Is everything a prototype?</p>
        <p>
          I think this connects to that Steve Jobs quote about the empowerment
          of understanding everything in the built world was designed by
          someone, and you can do it too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Qualities that might be in conflict with prototypey-ness are
          durability and safety. Important things!
        </p>
        <p>
          But I think a lot of objects aspire to a feeling of 'completeness'
          that is uneccesary. They want to conceal evidence of their
          construction. I want to show it.
