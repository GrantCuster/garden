              okay, to start, an analogy: long ago, a sing le person could build
              the best video game that existed. Adventure didn't require 200
              developers and 18 months to get out the door. as technology
              improved, so did expectations. Adventure was my goal. Today's
              kids' goal is fortnite. â€”<a

            One of the things I keep coming back to is the value of visible
            seams. The idea that you can look at something and develop a mental
            model of how it works or how it is made.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love the mental process of being able to look at something, and
            kind of load it into your head, rotate it, explode it, think about
            how you could make some interventions and try and trace out how they
            would propogate out. I want to make stuff where that people can do
            that with, and I'm hoping, if I aim it right, I can make things that
            not only explain themselves, but also open a path to understanding
            other things (other computer programs, maybe computers themselves).

            Computer programs and DIY furniture

            I mainly think about this in relation to computer programs, but it's
            interesting to compare how it plays out in software with how it
            plays out elsewhere. I've been doing some woordworking lately and
            thinking about visible construction in furniture. I think a lot of
            furniture does expose most of it's construction (especially the
            minimalist stuff I tend to like). The technology of Ikea furniture
            is mainly in the logistics and mass production. If you look at a
            specific bookshelf, you can probably reverse engineer and recreate
            it yourself. There is definitely some disguising (almost
            skeuomorphism) where the fiberboard nature of fiberboard is
            concealed.

            Wood as a material is interesting. It's a strange set of
            modifications that wood allows. The form we usually buy it in,
            straightened planks (which take a trememndous amount of logistical
            and operational effort to produce), are building blocks you can cut
            to size. You can glue or screw the cut pieces together. It plays
            best (at least in the context of the common tools and techniques
            available) with right angles. Once you've done some work with it you
            can understand a lot more of the built world around you.

            I've been doing a lot of work with plywood, which is a marvel in its
            uniformity and straightness. The aesthetics and politics of covering
            up plywood edges are interesting. I've been resisting doing it,
            honesty of materials and all that, but I may feel differently in the
            future. One thing I've been thinking about in terms of furniture in
            the home (or office) is how much the set of furniture around you
            influences your ideas of the possibilities. For me, if it's a set of
            pretty straightforward plywood constructions, I feel more
            comfortable modifying and making additions. I even feel a sense of
            calm from being able to look around and feel like "I understand how
            all of this was put together". For Youtube tutorial videos, I often
            find people's shop projects more interesting than their finished
            home solutions. The fine home stuff feels closed off to further
            development to me. Of course there's a balance there, I would not
            want to go full shop aesthetic in my apartment. But it's interesting
            to try and trace out how the surroundings affect my ideas of
            possibilities.

            I didn't really write much about computer programs. I feel like this
            fuzzily defined set of issues is something I want to keep coming
            back to, so I'll plan to write more in the future. I especially want
            to get into how legos and Minecraft fit into all of this.
