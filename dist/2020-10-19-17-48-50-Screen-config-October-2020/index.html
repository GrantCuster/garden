          <p>
            I've put both the desktop monitors in vertical orientation, like an
            open book (or a huge Surface Duo). I think for doing text-based work
            on the computer (code or writing) this is the ideal set-up. It's
            really nice they're both the 16:10 resolution (instead of the
            increasingly popular 16:9). 1200 pixels across is a comfy amount of
            horizontal space for writing. These monitors run off the Intel NUC.
          </p>
          <h3 id="laptop1-for-rendering">Laptop+1 for rendering</h3>
          <p>
            Mostly I develop things seen in a web browser. I figured out I could
            use my laptop screen as a web browser preview device. Especially
            since its aspect ratio is a more common size then a split on my
            vertical monitor. This set-up is also conceptually pleasing. It
            feels like all the dev work is happening on these two utilitarian
            vertical monitors, and then it is rendered out on the laptop device
            (which, among other things, has denser pixels).
          </p>
          <p>
            I also have a portable monitor (same resolution as the laptop), that
            I got when I was doing everything (often in the backyard) on the
            laptop. I'm using that as a secondary rendering screen. Often I have
            the terminal running the local dev server on there (just to keep an
            eye on it). Sometimes I have a video or music player. I'm still
            working out what feels best there. I also like having a todo list
            always visible.
          </p>
          <h3 id="powering-the-monitors">Powering the monitors</h3>
          <p>
            This has been a journey. At first I was running everything off the
            laptop with a dock that used DisplayLink to power the three extra
            monitors. DisplayLink, despite what looks like heroic effort on the
            part of open source devs, is pretty buggy on Ubuntu. It worked but
            it was consuming a lot of CPU and often crashing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd never really thought hard about what it takes to drive a bunch
            of monitors. I knew more pixels required more effort, but I thought
            that since my monitors are relatively low resolution (less in total
            than a 4k), I'd be OK. But it turns out there's also just the matter
            of having enough ports, which my laptop does not. DisplayLink solved
            the port issue but just wasn't working that well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, I'm now running the two vertical monitors off an Intel NUC,
            through the provided ports. The laptop runs itself and also the
            external portable display. I run
            <a
              href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.debauchee.barrier"
              >Barrier</a
            >
            to use my mouse and keyboard across both computers. It's early days,
            but it has been extremely surprising to me how well this works.
            There is noticeable lag on the keyboard/mouse sometimes. But I'm not
            actually on the laptop that much -- as I mentioned I usually use it
            render web previews and play videos or music. Things I have to get
            set-up and occasionally refresh but am not doing a lot of work in.
          </p>

          <p>
            Part of the reason mouse and keyboard sharing feels as good as it
            does is that I have my desktop and laptop similarly configured. I'll
            write more in-depth about it another time, but I'm running i3wm on
            both, which makes for a great multi-monitor experience. It will
            probably be a bit of a pain to keep their configs in sync (I'm
            investigating ways to do it). But it will also will force me to have
            portable Linux configs in general, which will come in handy if I
            have to wipe one of them or set-up a new machine at some point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compared to other Linux workflow topics, I've found less info on a
            multi-machine set-up. Part of it is just about networking, which it
            seems like a lot of the Linux blogs assume you already know how to
            do <code>ssh</code> and <code>sftp</code> stuff. I'm learning, but
            still trying to get a handle on the big picture of what is possible.
            I think I want to run most things off the desktop. Which I can do in
            terms of <code>ssh</code>ing from the laptop (although when they're
            all connected that does get me into a weird situation where I'm
            sending keyboard and mouse commands through Barrier from the desktop
            to the laptop, then running those commands through the laptop in a
            desktop terminal session...). Right now, I'm thinking I want to
            mostly share files from the desktop, so it almost becomes a NAS.
            Then I could do stuff like take the laptop somewhere else in the
            house and write code and save it back directly to the desktop, so
            that for code I'm working on the desktop copy is the source of
            truth.
          </p>
          <h3 id="local-dev-server">Local dev server</h3>
          <p>
            I use a node module called <code>reload</code> to run a local server
            for web apps I'm developing. It watches the directory and
            automatically reloads the page on changing. I was pleased to
            discover this worked exactly the same way if I loaded the IP address
            from my desktop on to my laptop screen. This really makes the
            "laptop as render screen" work smoothly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I sometimes daydream about displaying my in-progress work to people
            passing by. This process made me realize I could do that relatively
            easier with another screen + computer (possibly a Raspberry Pi)
            directed at that local dev server.
