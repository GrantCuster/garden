            CSS: end-user styling possibilities
          </h1>
          <p>
            I'm excited about CSS again. After experimenting with making
            layout-from-scratch apps with WebGL/Three.js in an attempt to avoid
            the sprawl (and creating my own mini-sprawl in the process) I'm
            rethinking approaches.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm interested in making applications where users customize with
            their own CSS. My bet is that if we get the initial primitives
            right, this could allow users to truly customize and feel at home in
            their spaces.
          </p>
          <h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
          <p>
            What do you get from letting users directly write CSS in the
            application:
          </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Styles are instantly applied.</li>
            <li>You don't need to worry about performance (in most cases).</li>
            <li>
              The application is transparent -- you can copy copy and paste or
              change selectors to apply from one section to another.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2 id="learning-css">Learning CSS</h2>
          <p>
            Most people don't know CSS, and it is not intuitive to get started
            with. It does have some things going for it in this regard, though:
          </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              It's tinkerable. Particularly if you start the app with a template
              and show all the styles applied, you set people up to start
              changing things and observing the changes, my favorite way of
              learning.
            </li>
            <li>
              The documentation is out there. The web is full of great guides
              (<a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a>,
              <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/tutorials/css/"
                >Josh Comeau</a
              >) on how to use and think about CSS. Compare this to trying to
              set up your own customization system for you app, which you then
              have to explain and support for your users.
            </li>
            <li>
              The skills transfer. Learning CSS can be a springboard into web
              dev. It was for me with Tumblr and WordPress. It can be for many
              others.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2 id="css.gui">CSS.gui</h2>
          <p>
            A super interesting recent development here is
            <a href="https://components.ai/open-source/css-gui">CSS GUI</a> by
            Components AI. Their goal is to provide a GUI for editing all CSS
            properties. What I love about this is how closely it maps to CSS --
            it's quite possibly the missing step in a ramp from no styling to
            custom CSS.
          </p>
          <h3 id="complexity-trade-offs">Complexity trade-offs</h3>
          <p>
            Because it needs to stick to the CSS spec, the GUI for CSS.gui is
            often going to be a little more verbose than an app like Figma's
            might be. But I think the trade-off, where you're actually
            manipulating the CSS itself, is worth it in a lot of cases. Figma
            styling (and before that photoshop and illustrator) has it's own
            quirks, born out of edge-case handling, that designers learn to
            navigate. They handle these quirks to make their design, then they
            hand-off to engineers who handle web quirks to make that design
            happen. But what if both were aligned from the start on working
            within the same set of quirks... I'm fascinated by the idea of the
            web as a material, and a GUI working off CSS feels closer to working
            with the material directly.

          <h2 id="the-importance-of-structure">The importance of structure</h2>
          <p>
            How much true customization a user can do with CSS, and how easy it
            is for them to do it, is dependent on how the app is structured.
            This is a design challenge I'm currently interested in. I would
            break it down into these related parts:
          </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              Structure of the app. Cleaner structure (fewer nested divs) will
              make applied CSS properties much easier to read about.
            </li>
            <li>
              Classnames and Ids. You want to give people intuitive selectors to
              hook into. You also want to expose them to people -- you can lean
              on developer tools to an extent, but it would be nice to be even
              more upfront about it.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This is something I've been playing with in things like
            <a href="https://cascade.constraint.systems">Cascade</a>. It's more
            art than science, and there could be lots of different approaches
            that might resonate more depending on the app and the user. I like
            that this part is something like a partnership with the users. It
            becomes more about providing the user the right toolset.
          </p>
          <h2 id="special-challenges-position-and-size">
            Special challenges: position and size
          </h2>
          <p>
            A big challenge is the fuzzy line between style and functionality. I
            see this come up the most with position and size. It is my current
            take that position and size should mainly be controlled by the
            application (not through CSS customization) and that this should be
            directly manipulatable. Something like a box model where you can
            move and resize the boxes through direct manipulation. There is
            overlap there, a lot of CSS properties can affect size and position
            and they may collide in unituitive ways. This is one of the main
            challenges I've been exploring and I don't think I've cracked it
            yet.
          </p>
          <p>Some strategies:</p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              Make the styles applied transparent, and even toggle-able, so if
              there is a collision the user can reason about it and decide how
              they want to handle it
            </li>
            <li>
              Determine size based on content, a lot of the experiments I've
              done have been using text-boxes, if you calculate their size based
              off content, you can apply styles like font size and border size
              in a way that feels 'reasonable' to the user.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            I'm sure there are more strategies, this seems like the thorniest
            and most interesting part of the design challenge to me.

              My Cascade experiment in collaborative CSS reinforced my belief in
              the creative potential of it. It was also an interesting
              experiment in providing a structure for people to modify.

              I've been experimenting with an even more customizable block-based
              model, where all styling is applied through CSS blocks. It also
              features a zoomable infinite canvas, which is partly a solution to
              how to keep all of this info approachable without it taking over
              the app. These experiments solidified my belief that CSS can
              provide really rich customization experiences. It also got very
              sprawling, so I am now trying to scope it back down and explore
              some of these ideas in isolation.

            <li>
              To try and scope things down from the freeform editor, I've been
              experimenting with something more list-based. This is something
              like an outline editor (Workflowy, Roam) with customizable, scoped
              CSS blocks for each nesting. It's promising but also getting
              pretty sprawling once again. The interaction between layout and
              CSS is once again the thorniest part... but really interesting to
              try and work through.
