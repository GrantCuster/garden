          Low-stakes physical materials
        </h1>
        <p>
          Compared to digital constructions, there is a higher cost to starting
          over with physical work. But there are materials you can choose where
          it's much lower-stakes, and I've been having fun assembling a set of
          them:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cardboard: a standby of prototyping, easily cut, surprisingly
            sturdy, readily available from shipping boxes, if cardboard wasn't
            so ubiquitous it would be a lot more appreciated. I at least do a
            first version on most things in cardboard, and often it lasts long
            enough that it stays cardboard. Goes great with hot glue but usually
            I just use tape.
          </li>
          <li>
            Masking tape: good for cardboard, good for taping up inspiration,
            good for writing on with sharpie.
          </li>
          <li>
            Air-drying clay: this a new one. I've made some keyboard palm rests,
            a new housing for a wireless phone charger, and a holder for a set
            of cards. Not as nice looking as fired clay, it's still wonderful to
            be able to sit down with an idea and rough it out in 15 minutes.
            Clay gives you shapes cardboard and wood aren't friendly too.
          </li>
          <li>
            Velco - I've got rolls of velcro with adhesive on one side. Makes
            for easy keyboard and phone mounts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Monitor poles and arms: I've rearranged monitors so many times.
            Poles and the arms that go on them are generally modular and you can
            figure out ways to mount non-monitor things as well. Most recently I
            used hose clamps to mount plywood panels flat against the poles. You
            can also get them in suprisingly tall sizes. If I were running a
            co-working space I'd make walls out of them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plywood: wood requires a lot more tools and set-up. I've got a
            decent set now, but I still try and set some constraints to not get
            bogged down in perfectionism. I got four sheets of 3/4" birch from
            home depot a while ago, and they lasted me many years. Lately I've
            taken to breaking down old under-used projects and reusing the wood,
            feels surprisingly satisfying. I try and keep it simple. Cut into
            rectangular shapes, mostly hold together with wood glue -- screws
            when needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hinges and connector plates: with the plywood I've been venturing
            into hinges. Had a real "there are no rules" realization moment with
            the fact that you can just go buy hinges and make whatever kind of
            folding hinge-y thing you want. Starting to notice all the hinges
            around me.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fabric and sewing: I've done some bag modifications, often using the
            velcro. I think there's a lot more I could do here. Fabric, like
            clay, is a kind of differently shaped thing than cardboard and wood,
            having better capabilities there will probably open up some new
            possibilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Legs: having my adjustable standing desk legs separate from the desk
            top has led to a few rounds of experimentation. You can just
            generally take and reattach the legs from lots of things.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plexiglass: I've mixed in a bit of plexi with some of my wood work.
            It's a little pricier, especially as you get thicker, so I only have
            thin stuff which in turn feels a little delicate when you stretch it
            over too great an area. Haven't quite got the feel for when to reach
            for it but I'll get there someday.
          </li>
          <li>
            Screens and keyboards: this is stretching a bit, but having lots of
            custom-built keyboards and random monitors around does encourage
            more weird computer constructions, and as long as you don't break
            them, they can be repurposed again and again.
          </li>
