            Low-stakes physical materials
          </h1>
          <p>
            Compared to digital constructions, there is a higher cost to
            starting over with physical work. But there are materials you can
            choose where it's much lower-stakes, and I've been having fun
            assembling a set of them:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Cardboard: a standby of prototyping, easily cut, surprisingly
              sturdy, readily available from shipping boxes, if cardboard wasn't
              so ubiquitous it would be a lot more appreciated. I at least do a
              first version on most things in cardboard, and often it lasts long
              enough that it stays cardboard. Goes great with hot glue but
              usually I just use tape.
            </li>
            <li>
              Masking tape: good for cardboard, good for taping up inspiration,
              good for writing on with sharpie.
            </li>
            <li>
              Air-drying clay: this a new one. I've made some keyboard palm
              rests, a new housing for a wireless phone charger, and a holder
              for a set of cards. Not as nice looking as fired clay, it's still
              wonderful to be able to sit down with an idea and rough it out in
              15 minutes. Clay gives you shapes cardboard and wood aren't
              friendly too.
            </li>
            <li>
              Velco - I've got rolls of velcro with adhesive on one side. Makes
              for easy keyboard and phone mounts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Monitor poles and arms: I've rearranged monitors so many times.
              Poles and the arms that go on them are generally modular and you
              can figure out ways to mount non-monitor things as well. Most
              recently I used hose clamps to mount plywood panels flat against
              the poles. You can also get them in suprisingly tall sizes. If I
              were running a co-working space I'd make walls out of them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Plywood: wood requires a lot more tools and set-up. I've got a
              decent set now, but I still try and set some constraints to not
              get bogged down in perfectionism. I got four sheets of 3/4" birch
              from home depot a while ago, and they lasted me many years. Lately
              I've taken to breaking down old under-used projects and reusing
              the wood, feels surprisingly satisfying. I try and keep it simple.
              Cut into rectangular shapes, mostly hold together with wood glue
              -- screws when needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hinges and connector plates: with the plywood I've been venturing
              into hinges. Had a real "there are no rules" realization moment
              with the fact that you can just go buy hinges and make whatever
              kind of folding hinge-y thing you want. Starting to notice all the
              hinges around me.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fabric and sewing: I've done some bag modifications, often using
              the velcro. I think there's a lot more I could do here. Fabric,
              like clay, is a kind of differently shaped thing than cardboard
              and wood, having better capabilities there will probably open up
              some new possibilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Legs: having my adjustable standing desk legs separate from the
              desk top has led to a few rounds of experimentation. You can just
              generally take and reattach the legs from lots of things.
            </li>
            <li>
              Plexiglass: I've mixed in a bit of plexi with some of my wood
              work. It's a little pricier, especially as you get thicker, so I
              only have thin stuff which in turn feels a little delicate when
              you stretch it over too great an area. Haven't quite got the feel
              for when to reach for it but I'll get there someday.
            </li>
            <li>
              Screens and keyboards: this is stretching a bit, but having lots
              of custom-built keyboards and random monitors around does
              encourage more weird computer constructions, and as long as you
              don't break them, they can be repurposed again and again.
