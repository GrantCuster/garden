                WebGL, 3D projection and mental models
              </h1>
              <p>
                I'm working on recreating some graphics editing programs in
                WebGL. To be able to zoom in on images, I've implemented a
                pretty standard 3D camera with projection and view matrices.
                I've found really understanding projection to be difficult. It's
                one thing to get some cubes placed and rendering in the world,
                it's another thing to enable mouse interactions, where you have
                to project and unproject between screen space, view space and
                world space.
              </p>
              <p>
                Figuring out the steps for transitioning between the spaces has
                been difficult, but a nice consequence is that I'm developing a
                mental model of what is happening on screen that I can reason
                about. The idea is that the screen reperesents a flat window
                onto 3D space that extends behind it. I'm starting to be able to
                intuitively reason about when I can keep something in screen
                space (the cursor), and when I want to project it into world
                space (creating a bounding box on an image). Mouse-directed zoom
                (as movement along a ray projected from the mouse), took me a
                while to get right, but now I feel like I have a better handle
                on what it is doing then when I've implemented it in a non-3D
                camera set-up.
