            Riding home on the train. The repo on my work computer isn't
            up-to-date, but since these are all markdown files I can write and
            trust it will work when I upload later.

            A bit of a dip in my new writing habit, mostly because my parents
            were in town for the weekend. Also maybe have some sort of lingering
            illness. Hoping it's just a temporary blip. I'm still enjoying the
            idea of this blog.
          </p>
          <p>
            Been trying to take some stock of where my work and projects are at.
            The pace of AI experimentation feels a bit exhausting, and a lot of
            it feels like hype. At the same time there do appear to be some
            movements towards steerability, to interaction at a more
            feature-based and interpretable level that are interesting to me.
            I'm still looking to carve at the joints and put the right pieces
            together in the right order to make something that feels empowering
            and extended, rather than a replacement. But it varies day-to-day
            how achievable and likely I think that is.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing I'd like to explore more is how I should treat AI
            advancements in relation to kind of daily programming. I think
            Maggie Appleton mentioned feeling like focusing on craft in web
            engineering now feels a bit like you're working in the twilight of
            an era.
          </p>
          <p>
            That fits with something I heard at the
            <em>Infinite Wonderland</em> event with Google. One of the artists,
            I think it was Shawna X, talked about an issue with AI speeding up
            the creation process too much. Where you didn't have this kind of
            ramp up time with an idea, where you're doing something like
            sketching or picking colors (or in my case I feel like the
            equivalent is kind of getting a project repo ready, getting
            everything structured, etc.). Your brain is often processing the
            larger project in the background during this period. There's this
            nice feeling of kinding of sharpening your tools as the shape of the
            thing hopefully starts to untangle a bit in your head.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you can go from idea to prototype (or even artifact) too fast do
            you lose that valuable processing time?
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, as was brought up at the event, there's nothing stopping
            you from doing things the old way, from spinning up just how you
            want to. And the perspective that emerges from that may be even more
            valuable if others are skipping it. Everything should shake out. But
            it's hard to trust in the sort of deluge of things created (but that
            could make it all the more valuable to do).
