            Writing this from the backyard using the AR glasses plus the mini PC
            in the cross-body bag. Trying to get more of a feel for it.
            Definitely still a lot of wires to track, and I don't trust things
            like the bluetooth keyboard to work all the time. The transparent
            mode is pretty, though.

            Now writing this on the porch with the AR glasses. I think I finally
            got Network Manager set up so I feel more confident I can take these
            and connect to wifi outside of my own. Maybe I'll take them on their
            first train ride tomorrow.

            I'm happy I've gotten as far as I did on this blog but I'm not quite
            sure how to use threads and untitled posts yet. Untitled posts feel
            weird even though part of the goal was to normalize that. Threads
            feel weird to, like it feels like I'm really declaring something
            important for it to be a thread. I want it to feel lightweight.
