            Towards more manageable pointer events

          <p>
            Working with mouse and touch events is one of the biggest challenges
            for me in making interactive web apps. The availability of
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events"
              >pointer events</a
            >
            helps a lot, but I still pretty quickly end up with a mess of
            conditionals that are hard to reason about. I'm working on some new
            strategies and abstractions to help with this.

          <h2 id="pointerone-pointertwo-pointerthree">
            PointerOne, PointerTwo, PointerThree
          </h2>
          <p>
            The pointer event API provides events for <code>pointerDown</code>,
            <code>pointerMove</code>, and <code>pointerUp</code>. Using the
            <code>pointerId</code> provided you can link those events together
            into a continuous Pointer object that contains the whole lifecycle.
            I put this together into a <code>SubPointer</code> class.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>SubPointer</code>'s feed into another level of
            abstraction, based on how many active touches there are:
            <code>PointerOne</code>, <code>PointerTwo</code>, and
            <code>PointerThree</code>. This is meant to match how I think about
            these actions ("I want to do this when the user has two fingers
            down"). All of them feature fields for the <code>initial</code> and
            <code>current</code> pointer position. I use those values for things
            like drag (pan the canvas based on the distance between
            <code>current</code> and <code>initial</code>).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can see code and a very barebones demo of this approach at
            https://github.com/GrantCuster/pointy.
          </p>
          <h3 id="averaging-pointers">Averaging pointers</h3>
          <p>
            Something I formalized in this set-up is the idea of average
            pointers. When two fingers are down I average their position to get
            the midpoint between them (same for three). This makes a lot of
            actions, like moving the canvas on two-finger drag and rotating the
            camera on three-finger drag, more straightforward to code. I can
            mostly just feed in the values from the average Pointer.
          </p>
          <h3 id="managing-lifecycles">Managing lifecycles</h3>
          <p>
            The separate pointer abstraction also helps me think more clearly
            about pointer continuity. When you add a second touch, the
            already-active first touch continues. But I think you generally want
            to throw away that first touch, and 'start from scratch' with a new
            two-touch event. An example touch setup:
          </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>One-finger drag: draw an area select</li>
            <li>Two-finger drag: pan the canvas</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            In this case when you move from one-finger to two-finger you want to
            end or cancel the one-finger drag action, and in terms of dragging,
            you want to reset the initial value to an average of both pointers'
            current location. I work this out in the
            <code>SubPointer</code> class so that the
            <code>PointerOne</code> and <code>PointerTwo</code> behavior is
            exactly what I expect. Basically anytime the number of touches
            switch it ends the current Pointer and starts the new one. The logic
            in <code>SubPointer</code> still gets kind of gnarly but at least
            it's contained there. Overall I like the behavior of having a higher
            set of abstractions that, for my purposes 'just work', powered by a
            lower set of abstractions that I can dip into when I need to.
          </p>
          <h2 id="keyboard-mouse-buttons">Keyboard mouse buttons</h2>
          <p>
            Another big driver of complexity in my input management is keyboard
            events and modifiers. Modifying the pointer behavior based on a
            pressed key is often intuitive to the user but will snarl your
            pointer handling code quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm experimenting with an approach based on how the pointer events
            work. The trick here again turns out to be about managing
            lifecycles.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have a key that modifies pointer behavior you need to think
            about how you're going to handle a user starting a pointer event
            then pressing the key, then unpressing the key, all while the touch
            is still active. I decided to just 'interrupt' the current touch
            behavior and restart it. That way I only need to check for the
            relevant keypress on <code>PointerOne</code>'s start and move
            events. My conditionals in those events are still growing larger
            than I'd like, but at least they're contained and easier to reason
            about.
          </p>
          <p>
            In effect this approach is turning key presses into
            <code>pointerDown</code> (and <code>pointerUp</code>) events. It's
            early days but so far this approach has it made it much easier for
            me to reason about key and pointer combos.
