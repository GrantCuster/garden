            Fantasy consoles and framing
          </h1>
          <p>
            I've been thinking a lot about
            <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=31634"
              >Joseph White's talk on his motivations for making the PICO-8
              fantasy console</a
            >. There's so much in the talk that resonates with what I've been
            thinking about for
            <a href="https://constraint.systems">Constraint Systems</a>: about
            how carefully selected constraints change the feel of working,
            making it feel more focused, and even cozy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since viewing the talk I've been thinking a lot about how he frames
            PICO-8 with the idea of a fantasy console and cartridges, and what I
            could do for framing Constraint Systems. I've toyed with the idea of
            making the Constraint Systems homepage into a simulation of a
            fantasy operating system with each experiment as an application.
            Part of the feeling I want to capture is going to the middle school
            computer lab in the mid 90s and trying out the strange collection of
            software the school had preloaded (even though the variety of the
            internet is great, there is something comforting and cozy in the
            idea of a finite number of programs to explore).
          </p>
          <p>
            I had been thinking of the operating system metaphor as a fun,
            possibly attention-attracting, thing, that I should get around to
            sometime. After viewing White's talk, however, I think it's
            something I should prioritize. Framing Constraint Systems as a
            fantasy computer/operating system could (done well) communicate my
            vision of the project, and communicate it not in a long text
            somebody has to read, but as a general vibe. In the best case, they
            would "get" the project just by looking at the homepage. This is
            what "branding" is, I suppose, it just feels more tied to the core
            of the project here than I'm used to thinking of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Extensions of the idea: - The simplest version is just presenting
            the Constraint System experiments as different apps on a fantasy
            operating system. I could also try and make them behave as apps.
            Possibly using iframes and a tiling window management system. A
            further step (that I've always wanted to do) would be to let you
            pipe the output of one application into another. - Picking up on the
            middle school computer lab vibe, I wonder if Constraint Systems
            could someday be a physical computer lab, where computers limited to
            only CS software are available free for anyone to use, and I
            administer the lab and get to see what people make and can adjust or
            make new applications based on what people are doing with it. (I
            think this is at least a good idea for an installation or area at a
            hackerspace.)
