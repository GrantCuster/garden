![Desk with hanging box for mixer and hinged box for cords.](https://grant-uploader.s3.amazonaws.com/2024-11-03-20-07-25-2000.jpg)

Three small additions to the desk today. Trying to tidy up based on where things have accumulated.

            <description><![CDATA[# Work: Basement project table

![Basement project table with sewing machine and marked off project section](https://grant-uploader.s3.amazonaws.com/2024-11-03-07-51-41-2000.jpg)

I feel like these quick builds are an exercise in building intuition about "how wood goes together". And then using it is building intuition about "what makes a table feel good to use", that then feeds into the next build.

## Process

Built out of 3/4" plywood and 2x6s (because I'm out of 2x4s). Nice to be at a stage where I can do this in a couple of hours. A bit wobbly either because of cuts or more likely the floor. But anchoring to the wall solved that. Left a reminder (mostly to myself) to keep it clear.

![Left wall I've my office, now filled with shoebox-sized bins.](https://grant-uploader.s3.amazonaws.com/2024-11-01-14-49-38-2000.jpg)

I've gone all in on clear shoebox + masking tape storage. Great for locating cords and small electronics so far. Still more to be figured out in terms of overall sorting (I'm hoping a natural cache will emerge?).]]></description>
