            Something I think a lot about is what level of abstraction to attack
            a problem on. Here is a loose cataglog of where I've been thinking
            about it lately.
          </p>
          <h2 id="react-libraries">React libraries</h2>
          <p>
            Previously I've been reluctant to use libraries in my react code,
            generally preferring to roll my own solutions, believing that you
            tend to hit a wall with what you can do with libraries and working
            around their limitations becomes as much or more work than building
            your own. There are things I would use, like state management
            libraries, but I figured most of the interaction stuff I'd rather do
            myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            On my recent project I've been useing react gesture and react dnd
            kit, and they've been helping in terms of getting me moving faster
            and also thinking about how to structure things. React DND kit in
            particular has this nice set-up where you can generally access
            either the object you're dropping into or the object your dragging
            from the drag or drop component. Their turn out to be cases for both
            and I think, had I been rolling it myself, I probably would have
            felt bad splitting them out like that.
          </p>
          <h2 id="react">React</h2>
          <p>
            I settled on using React quite a while ago. I think there are lots
            of good ideas in there. I think what has changed is how much I trust
            it and how much I "live in React world". Partly out of necessity, a
            lot of my earlier projects escaped out of React to use three.js or
            draw to a canvas directly. These days I've been staying in Rect, and
            rendering with DOM elements. I think this is partly a shift in my
            mindset, and partly a feature of React getting a lot more performant
            in how it batches events. Browser tech, like more CSS layout options
            and better transform performance, have also made it possible for
            infinite canvas apps.

          <h2 id="just-javascript">Just JavaScript</h2>
          <p>
            Dan Abramove and Maggie Appleton made Just Javascript, which was a
            really interesting investigation of aligning the user's mental model
            of JavaScript with how JavaScript works -- particularly on the
            subject of object and property references (which were super helpful
            for me to nail down).

            Tailwind, a light abstraction on top of CSS, almost just
            autocomplete, but also gives you this sense of scale, it buckets
            things for you. I can also take tailwind defaults as signs of what
