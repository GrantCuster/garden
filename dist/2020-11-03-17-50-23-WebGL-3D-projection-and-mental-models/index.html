            WebGL, 3D projection and mental models
          </h1>
          <p>
            I'm working on recreating some graphics editing programs in WebGL.
            To be able to zoom in on images, I've implemented a pretty standard
            3D camera with projection and view matrices. I've found really
            understanding projection to be difficult. It's one thing to get some
            cubes placed and rendering in the world, it's another thing to
            enable mouse interactions, where you have to project and unproject
            between screen space, view space and world space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Figuring out the steps for transitioning between the spaces has been
            difficult, but a nice consequence is that I'm developing a mental
            model of what is happening on screen that I can reason about. The
            idea is that the screen reperesents a flat window onto 3D space that
            extends behind it. I'm starting to be able to intuitively reason
            about when I can keep something in screen space (the cursor), and
            when I want to project it into world space (creating a bounding box
            on an image). Mouse-directed zoom (as movement along a ray projected
            from the mouse), took me a while to get right, but now I feel like I
            have a better handle on what it is doing then when I've implemented
            it in a non-3D camera set-up.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I have done image editors with zoom in the past, things have
            always gotten messy while dealing with translation and zoom. Now I
            feel like maybe that is because I was mixing 2D and 3D concepts.
            Placing images in 3D perspective space with a camera has required a
            lot of set-up, but I'm now starting to believe it will really pay
            off.
          </p>
          <p>
            The thing where the world is transformed to place the camera at
            origin through the view matrix is still giving me some headaches.
            But I'm getting excited about the possibilities that could open up
            after I've internalized more of this stuff
