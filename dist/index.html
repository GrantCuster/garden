        <p>
          I was writing a lot and then I decided I needed to redo the blog and
          then I thought I can't write more until I finish redoing the blog and
          so I wasn't writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I pushed this version. It's more like Twitter, with individual
          entries and also the ability to thread. There are some unaswered
          questions (like pagination). I also can't decide if I should move all
          my feed posts in here. They might overwhelm the writing posts, but I
          think I'd like to figure out a way everything can live together.

          Seeing the OG images I generate for this blog has me thinking. If you
          split a blog post by paragraphs and generated PNGs, and then you
          stitched those into a GIF with the frame time based on text length...
          that would maybe be a portable / embeddable blog post? Not good for
          accessibility and not to replace the post, but maybe an interesting
          derivative.

          This site is a bash build script that concats HTML together. I also
          put together a little start script using fzf that has some common task
          options new_post / build / commit. I really like the feel of the
          starting bash script - it makes it feel like writing in this blog is
          its own little dedicated computer program.

          Thinking about things that make you see the world around you

            >Egglant podcast interview with the Animal Well maker</a

          and they mentioned "secrets in plain sight" in the game and compared
          it to ARGs, where your street becomes something new/different to you
          because there is a geocache (or pokemon station there).

          What if I made a blog like this blog but also more like Twitter. Where
          I could make little posts, or I could also reply to old posts, bumping
          that 'thread' of posts to the top. But (like Twitter) it would show
          the update, with an indication and ability to click through to see the
          full thread.
        </p>
        <p>
          That seems kind of cool? Like it'd be good for long-running thoughts I
          keep returning to and also for WIP posts...

          I would say this garden has been a relative success in terms of
          helping me write more. I kind of want to combine it with my feed, and
          maybe my homepage?
        </p>
        <p>
          Feed would be the thing to do first I think. It's interesting trying
          to categorize the differences between posts. Garden is more writing
          based. Feed is structured around an image. Feed was designed to make
          sure I wasn't blocked trying to think of a title, that I could do more
          work-in-progress stuff. Maybe that's different now that garden is
          here.

        <p>
          One of the best things I had going with my old linux set up was my gif
          recording workflow. I had a few helper scripts connected to dmenu (and
          then I think rofi and fzf), where I could record the screen and then
          convert into gif. It was still a bit janky. But it made it pretty
          quick to take work-in-progress clips and post to
          <a href="https://feed.grantcuster.com">my feed</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I tore down my set-up and rebuilt on Ubuntu server install and
          Nix home-manager I haven't had a good gif set up. Tonight I think I
          got it fixed up though I'm sure I will continue to tinker.

          Of 'carving at the joints'.

          I'm not sure if it was from reflashing the keyboard firmware or

        <p>
          Trying to keep up the habit of quick writing in here. Now morning
          writing from the couch, the dog beside me, the baby exploring a
          cardboard box. A nice spring-like morning.

          Did some organizing syncing the setups yesterday. Still liking the
          Ubuntu + Nix configuration. Getting better and faster about keeping it
          up to date across the laptop and the mini PC. The server's a bit
          behind.

          Hopefully the first of many posts written while sitting on the porch.
          This is the first one I've got set up with the AR glasses.

          It was cool earlier when the light meant I could see more of the
          background, so it felt like a floating transparent screen. Now it's
          darker and the screen is less transparent.

          This blog!: I want to get preview images working. I'm trying to
          generate them using cairo, so I can do it as part of the build script.
          I would say I've proven out the basic concept, now need to decide on
          some text positioning and hook it all together for the first run.

          Mini PC: I'm working on getting a mini PC set up with the my current
          go-to Ubuntu server + Nix home-manager config. Eventually I want to
          try and make it a wearable deck to go with my AR glasses. Will write
          about that more later.

        <p>
          I want to make sure I can write from anywhere, including my work mac,
          which I'm writing on now. I had to update bash on the mac (I did it
          using Nix home manager). Otherwise things seem to be working well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Edit: also had to replace a <code>grep P</code> with a
          <code>sed</code>.

          Today I made this blog / garden. I want it to be a place where I can
          write quickly and with focus.

          Right now it's a bunch of bash scripts that put together some
          templates. I wanted to know exactly what was going on so that I'll be
          able to modify it in the future. Though to be transparent the bash
          scripts were AI assisted. Still, I think I understand all the steps.

          I'm excited for all the energy around tools for thought. Some notes on
          my current thoughts (probably to be revised in future entries).
