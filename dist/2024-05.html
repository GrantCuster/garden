              <p>
                I've always liked building systems where the joints are visible:
                legos, Minecraft. Lately I've been thinking about the process of
                learning how to find the joints in systems where they're less
                visible. Of 'carving at the joints'.

                I'm not sure if it was from reflashing the keyboard firmware or
                resetting the computer software but it's working now. It is
                nice. I'm not sure what lesson to take from this.

                Am I writing too many posts now? Still getting a feel for this
                thing. It is fun the ways different writing environments seep
                into the writing.

                I'm having trouble pairing my wireless keyboard with my mini PC.
                I keep trying new things and searching the proglem in different
                combos.
              </p>
              <p>
                My current theory is maybe the bluetooth driver isn't up to date
                enough? But I think it actually may be.

                Trying to keep up the habit of quick writing in here. Now
                morning writing from the couch, the dog beside me, the baby
                exploring a cardboard box. A nice spring-like morning.

              <p>
                Did some organizing syncing the setups yesterday. Still liking
                the Ubuntu + Nix configuration. Getting better and faster about
                keeping it up to date across the laptop and the mini PC. The
                server's a bit behind.

                Hopefully the first of many posts written while sitting on the
                porch. This is the first one I've got set up with the AR
                glasses.

                It was cool earlier when the light meant I could see more of the
                background, so it felt like a floating transparent screen. Now
                it's darker and the screen is less transparent.

                This blog!: I want to get preview images working. I'm trying to
                generate them using cairo, so I can do it as part of the build
                script. I would say I've proven out the basic concept, now need
                to decide on some text positioning and hook it all together for
                the first run.

                Mini PC: I'm working on getting a mini PC set up with the my
                current go-to Ubuntu server + Nix home-manager config.
                Eventually I want to try and make it a wearable deck to go with
                my AR glasses. Will write about that more later.

                I want to make sure I can write from anywhere, including my work
                mac, which I'm writing on now. I had to update bash on the mac
                (I did it using Nix home manager). Otherwise things seem to be
                working well.

                Edit: also had to replace a <code>grep P</code> with a

                Today I made this blog / garden. I want it to be a place where I
                can write quickly and with focus.
              </p>
              <p>
                Right now it's a bunch of bash scripts that put together some
                templates. I wanted to know exactly what was going on so that
                I'll be able to modify it in the future. Though to be
                transparent the bash scripts were AI assisted. Still, I think I
                understand all the steps.
