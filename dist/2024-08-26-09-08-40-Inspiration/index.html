            Thinking about

              >Spacefiller</a
            >'s work this morning. Specifically wondering how they're able to
            achieve such a feeling of solidity + presence for the plants. Part
            of it is the structure but I think a big part of it is the linework.
            There's no anti-aliasing and line's look like they're maybe four
            pixels wide (in visible world pixels, probably much higher in actual
            resolution).
          </p>

            I'm interested in creating digital spaces with a similar level of
            solidity. But I feel like introducing images often hurts the
            solidity - because the pixel pieces are too small to see. Obvious
            solution that I continue to experiment with is scale down the
            resolution and color of images, so that the pieces are more visible.
            That could hopefully make them feel more of a piece with a world
            like Spacefiller's. The dilemma is that often loses a lot of the
            semantic content (turns a face into a blob). This is part of why I'm
            interested in progressive pixelation that scales up or down in
            resolution depending on the content. Though my efforts there I think
            still lack the solid feel I'm after.
