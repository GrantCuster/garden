          Thinking about things that make you see the world around you
          differently: ARGs, birding, mushroom hunting, simulating physical
          phenomena in code, drawing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was listening to the
          <a
            href="https://eggplant.show/139-sticking-to-your-systems-with-animal-well"
            >Egglant podcast interview with the Animal Well maker</a
          >
          and they mentioned "secrets in plain sight" in the game and compared
          it to ARGs, where your street becomes something new/different to you
          because there is a geocache (or pokemon station there).
        </p>
        <p>
          That made me think about
          <a href="https://x.com/blprnt/status/1798698976495235307"
            >a tweet I saw yesterday from Jer Thorp</a
          >
          about how birding helps you to see more details around you. Someone
          else mentioned taking up mushroom hunting had a similar effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've thought about this when trying to simulate physical phenomena in
          code like water or raymarching, causes you to most closely observe the
          physical world.
        </p>
        <p>
          A classic example of this is drawing, where one of the best
          instructions I got from the art teacher was that you had to look at
          something how it actually looks, not how you think it looks.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my favorite explorations of this idea is China Mieville's The
          City &amp; the City, where two cities are overlaid on top of one
          another and living in one is a process of ignoring the other.
