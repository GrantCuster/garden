            Ted Chiang: Why AI isn't going to make art
          </h1>
          <p>
            More response writing! Here we go. Same rules, don't summarize, pick
            out what's interesting to me even if it leaves a bunch of other
            stuff out.
          </p>
          <p>
            First his definition: &gt; art is something that results from making
            a lot of choices.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of prompting to generate text or images, he argues, you
            are making very few choices.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              What I'm saying is that art requires making choices at every
              scale; the countless small-scale choices made during
              implementation are just as iportant to the final product as the
              few large-scale choices made during the conception. [...] the
              interrelationship between the large scale and the small scale is
              where the artistry lies.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            This is part of why I like making prototypes, going through the
            process of implementation, lots of small choices show up to be made,
            some of them suggest rippling, larger choices.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              I doubt you could replace every sentence in a thriller with one
              that is semantically equivalent and have the resulting novel be as
              entertaining.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>This actually seems like a doable generative experiment...</p>
          <p>Another big distinction, AI is not a language user because:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Language [...] requires an intention to communicate.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Made clear by the example of ChatGPT being unable to
            <em>mean</em> it when it says "I'm happy to see you".
          </p>
          <p>Ending is stirring but not completely rigorous.</p>
          <p>
            I like it best as meta-question of why do we create art why do we
            use language? There he puts the focus on intention.
          </p>
          <p>
            That seems right to me but also limited, if we were looking for
            sincere intention in art, art would quickly get repetitive. We are
            looking for novelty too, or a response to what's came before that
            appears as novelty, or originality. Truthfulness is part of it, I
            wonder what the rest is?
