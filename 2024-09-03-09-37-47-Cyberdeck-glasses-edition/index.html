            After trying out a
            <a href="/2024-04-22-20-46-52/">DIY deck version</a>, I've redone my
            cyberdeck experiment using AR glasses. It's not perfect but I've
            been using it pretty consistently on subway commutes and porch
            nights.

            The big plus of the mini PC is it has a powered display portout that
            can run the glasses, and another usb-c in for the battery (or laptop
            charger) power.

            This is an iteration of when I had a keyboard plugging into my
            iPhone. The
            <a href="https://garden.grantcuster.com/2024-03-11-00-36-36/"
              >exposed keyboard had a look</a

          <h2 id="software">Software</h2>
          <p>
            For software it runs the same thing I've been running everywhere
            these days. Ubuntu server with most things managed using Nix
            home-manager. Sway for a window manager. It is great to have things
            in sync with my Linux laptop, and close to sync (through
            home-manager) with the Mac I use at work.
          </p>
          <h2 id="visibility">Visibility</h2>
          <p>
            I run the glasses in monitor mode, so there's no eye-tracking or
            anything. The compatibility has been great (can plug and unplug just
            like any other monitor). Readability can be tough, especially when
            looking at corners. I have the display scaled up to 2xwhich
            basically solves readability at the cost of information density.
            Sway helps here, it feels great to have basically no system chrome
            in the way.

            The glasses work well in shade and rooms. In bright sunlight one of
            the biggest challenges is actually reflection up from your
            chest/shirt. The glasses cover helps a lot with this, it'd be cool
            to have a version that didn't also block out all light. A good
            candidate for 3D printing maybe.
          </p>
          <h2 id="the-keyboard">The keyboard</h2>
          <p>
            The keyboard is kind of its own whole deal, if you're doing this set
            up and aren't already deep in ergo keyboard world (see
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/"
              >ErgoMech subreddit</a
            >), just get a conventional bluetooth keyboard + trackpad combo.
            That said the keyboard (using the
            <a href="https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku">miryoku layout</a
            >) is a lot of fun as a lap keyboard, and the mouse keys feature is
            good in a pinch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bluetooth has been the biggest hiccup, though. Sometimes the
            connection is choppy, with lots of latency. I don't know enough to
            know if it's the keyboard broadcaster, the mini PC bluetooth
            receiver, the bluetooth software, or some combo. Will continue
            investigating that. If I'm having lots of trouble and going to be
            sat for a while I just plug it in and use as a USB keyboard since
            that works to.

          <h2 id="uses">Uses</h2>
          <h3 id="subway">Subway</h3>
          <p>
            So far I mostly use it on the subway to noodle on side projects or
            write things like this post. I have about 45 minutes on the train,
            so it's great to be able to use that time I'd otherwise probably
            dedicate to podcasts. I've sometimes pulled out a laptop on the
            subway, this is less obtrusive but probably looks weirder - still I
            hope it's mostly an enjoyable cyberpunk-ish curiousity for the other
            riders. Noone has said anything to me about it yet.
          </p>
          <h3 id="porch">Porch</h3>
          <p>
            I've also been using it on the porch, especially when trying to do
            some writing after the baby's gone to bed. This works OK - it's
            pretty with the neighbordhood visible in the background, but I also
            feel like I'm pushing myself to use it there. Part of using it is
            really appreciating the laptop form factor - the extra screen space
            (because not scaled), the ability to look at different parts of the
            screen without it following you around... I wouldn't be surprised if
            I shift back to that more. The glasses setup really shines for the
            portability. But it's also a matter of getting the kinks/friction
            out, it's possible if I get my software set up just the right way
            I'll reach for the glasses more.

          </p>
          <p>
            This doesn't involve the glasses but I realized I can plug the mini
            PC into the TV, it's kind of nice for an almost ambient coding
            experience, where I can drop in, change a few lines, then walk away
            and straighten something up. Maybe there's some fit with the
            <a href="">Ambient TV</a> setup there.
          </p>
          <h3 id="monitor">Monitor</h3>
          <p>
            It also works as a regular PC, I wasn't expecting to use it much
            this way, but it's nice if I'm in the process of working on
            something and need a change of scenery. The combined display port
            means it plugs right into a one-cord laptop dock.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mini PC is so small it's almost like plugging in a cartridge. I
            wonder if there's some fun/interesting setup with multiple
            task-specific mini PCs you swap out.
          </p>
          <h3 id="entertainment">Entertainment</h3>
          <p>
            I haven't pursued it much but I also want to have things set up to
            watch videos, particularly on subway rides where I don't get a seat.
            MPV and the media controls on bluetooth headphones should get me
            most of the way I think.

            The challenge with any of this homebrew deck stuff is it's going to
            have sharp edges. If you really want to do this it's doable, but it
            definitely has a time cost. I hope to continue to iterate and make
            things smoother - paving the way for more alternative setups.
