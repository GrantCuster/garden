        <p>
          Hopefully the first of many posts written while sitting on the porch.
          This is the first one I've got set up with the AR glasses.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was cool earlier when the light meant I could see more of the
          background, so it felt like a floating transparent screen. Now it's
          darker and the screen is less transparent.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll do a bigger post on the set up later, but I can list out briefly
          what I have going:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mele fanless mini PC</li>
          <li>Charging brick that outputs 45 watts</li>
          <li>Nreal AR Glasses</li>
          <li>Technikable keyboard</li>
          <li>Software running Sway and Neovim to write in</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The battery / glasses / mini PC combo was recommended on Reddit and
          I'm happy it's all working together so well. The keyboard fits in
          well, though I still want to get mouse keys working. I'm excited for
          writing in this, should also be good for entertainment, even, I think,
          on the subway. I want to get or make a good cross-body bag to use with
          it.
