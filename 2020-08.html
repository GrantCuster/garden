                Fantasy consoles and framing
              </h1>
              <p>
                I've been thinking a lot about
                <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=31634"
                  >Joseph White's talk on his motivations for making the PICO-8
                  fantasy console</a
                >. There's so much in the talk that resonates with what I've
                been thinking about for
                <a href="https://constraint.systems">Constraint Systems</a>:
                about how carefully selected constraints change the feel of
                working, making it feel more focused, and even cozy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since viewing the talk I've been thinking a lot about how he
                frames PICO-8 with the idea of a fantasy console and cartridges,
                and what I could do for framing Constraint Systems. I've toyed
                with the idea of making the Constraint Systems homepage into a
                simulation of a fantasy operating system with each experiment as
                an application. Part of the feeling I want to capture is going
                to the middle school computer lab in the mid 90s and trying out
                the strange collection of software the school had preloaded
                (even though the variety of the internet is great, there is
                something comforting and cozy in the idea of a finite number of
                programs to explore).
