        <p>
          I'm having trouble pairing my wireless keyboard with my mini PC. I
          keep trying new things and searching the proglem in different combos.
        </p>
        <p>
          My current theory is maybe the bluetooth driver isn't up to date
          enough? But I think it actually may be.
        </p>
        <p>
          The haunting thing is maybe it's just a bad state issue, and if I
          reset the right thing (firmware on the keyboard, bluetooth status on
          the keyboard) it will be all fixed up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I should leave it. I have other things to do. It can sit. I can use
          the keyboard in wired mode with the mini PC and it works fine.
        </p>
        <p>
          But every time I step away I think "well maybe..." and I have a strong
          urge to try something slightly different.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think this general pattern has probably served me well in many
          computer and life things and badly in others. I'm going to do some
          chores now, but I also want to reflash the firmware.
