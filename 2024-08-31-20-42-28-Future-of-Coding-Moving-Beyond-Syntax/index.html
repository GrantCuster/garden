            Future of Coding: Moving Beyond Syntax
          </h1>
          <p>
            I'd like to get into the habit of using this blog to write down
            responses and appreciations of things. So let's do that:
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been listening to the "Moving Beyond Syntax" episode from
            <em>Future of Coding</em> over the past couple days. Overall I've
            just really been enjoying <em>Future of Coding</em> episodes as a
            break from AI hype. As a reminder of all the interesting things
            there are still to do in programming as programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also think the addition of Lu has been great. Now (and especially
            in this episode) there are three distinct points of view from Lu,
            Ivan and Jimmy, that bounce off and contrast with each other. I
            think sometimes I get stuck wanting to know / cover everything, and
            listening and enjoying the back-and-forth is a good reminder that
            it's good to be coming from a perspective. That you're part of a
            larger conversation and you don't have to cover every angle
            yourself. A good thing for me to write about is what angle I am
            coming from these days.
          </p>
          <p>
            The episode was about AgentSheets, a programming language aimed at
            kids. I think things I enjoyed most in the episode were Jimmy
            pushing back against the limitations that some 'kid-friendly'
            languages impose. That his experience of programming was wanting to
            know what the computer was doing not have it abstracted away. Then
            again, I enjoyed Ivan pushing on the idea that that can be useful
            when doing 'computational thinking' about a topic, like how magnets
            work. In that genre of sort of explorable explanation, you may want
            to write code to see how a system operates, but you want to stay in
            the pocket of the system you're exploring, what the computer is
            doing is a distraction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both seem good points. Maybe it shows me that we should be more
            specific about learning to program. I would get excited about a kid
            exploring either of those paths, and can imagine both leading to
            programming. But it does seem like thinking about what the computer
            is doing is the pursuit of programming in a way the other might not
            be... not that there's any value attached either way. Probably ther
            person in pursuit of exploring something through computational
            thinking becomes a programmer partly out of frustration/necessity -
            interesting question if the tools were there and stable would they
            pursue programming, or pursue computational thinking around the
            things they're exploring...
          </p>
          <p>
            I also really enjoyed the discussion of embodiment. I've loved
            Papert's example of imagining yourself as gears or as the turtle. I
            don't think I really do that - though actually thinking about it
            always makes me think I should try more. Again, I loved the variety
            of experiences, and that you realize a variety of relationships to
            programming is good, especially in conversation with each other.
