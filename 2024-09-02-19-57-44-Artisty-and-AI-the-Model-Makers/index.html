            Some of the most interesting responses I saw to Ted Chiang's piece:

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The easy unlock re the cyclical AI art culture war that will seem
              obvious in retrospect is that the people creating models are
              artists
            </p>
            <p>
              The same rules apply as in Chiang's piece. Some intervene in a
              deliberate manner in every stage of the process, some make rote
              and inelegant choices
            </p>

            and this
            <a href="https://x.com/timhwang/status/1830630445072961903"

            from Tim Hwang again emphasizing model making
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>for chiang, good art is about <em>choices</em>, lots of them</p>
            <p>
              if choice is art, pretraining a model is absolutely an art, and
              fine-tuning nearly always is too
            </p>
            <p>
              model architectures, dataset selection, evaluation structures are
              all deeply matters of curation, taste, and aesthetics
            </p>
            <p>
              like many people, chiang gets lost in the “push button, get art”
              implementations we see in the market
            </p>
            <p>he blunders here</p>
            <p>
              chiang mistakes these apps as reflecting something
              <em>inherent</em> in language models as a technology, rather than
              a design choice on the part of the designer
            </p>
            <p>
              this is why the analogy connecting LLMs as an art form to gaming
              as an art form is so important
            </p>
            <p>
              game design is an artistic act, but whether or not the
              interactivity that game allows is artistically worthwhile is
              separate question, defined by choice on the part of the designer
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            These were <em>fun</em>, I like to imagine a world of weird models
            put forward as art objects to explore.
          </p>
          <p>Does it seem like this is where things are headed thougn?</p>
          <p>
            I haven't been thinking this way. I think because I've mainly been
            focused on using models in a programming context, where I'm looking
            for capabilities to fit into apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            And the narrative so far has just been scaling things up further and
            further, so that all kinds of responses are available within a
            model, you just need to prompt yourself into it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm trying to think of things where the model's 'personality' or at
            least 'angle' is interesting. I've seem people speak about Claude
            that way, but even if there are edges where you can see the
            personality there, it still seems to me it's in such a capability
            race that I can't see real aesthetic-based curation happening. Like
            I can't imagine them choosing to leave out certain data because it
            doesn't fit the vibe if the data would contribute to performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or, like, Midjourney has/had an aesthetic, but it feels like their
            goal is/will be 'anything you want to create, in any style' that
            just seems to be the way these push.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe the variety shakes out more after the big capability race
            settles a bit, maybe synthetic data gets all capabilities to a point
            where more curation is possible and wanted.
          </p>
          <p>
            And the idea of curating a dataset to define a model, does have some
            nice analogies - it feels like breeding grape varieties for wine or
            something. Where your intelligence about adding just a hint of this
            edgy data to balance out a mostly sophisticated set - and then a
            tasting with notes like 'a hint of this subreddit'.
          </p>
          <p>
            But in that example what is it you actually do with the model?
            Maaaybe it's a chatbot? No I think better if it's language then it's
            some sort of interactive storytelling - in which case the big thing
            it would need to be is distilled - so that you could see it's value
            immediately because the potentiol for slop is so high...
          </p>
          <p>So it's fun to think about but gets very fuzzy.</p>
          <p>
            To pin something for another day: part of the question is how to
            distinguish a subtle, artist-trained model/work versus just a huge
            model prompted into that space. Part of it maybe that you couldn't
            jailbreak out of the artist model? In that way maybe it is like a
            game design...
